    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, I set up my Raspberry Pi as a music server so that I could listen to music without
having to deal with keeping my laptop in a certain corner of the room.</p>

<p>After setting it all up, it occurred to me: &ldquo;I can do much more with this!&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Waking up to go to class in the morning is always a challenge for me. It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t wake up
&mdash; I often wake up, cancel all the alarms, and go back to bed. Half-asleep me somehow has the
skill to turn off alarms, but not the discipline of going to class<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I&rsquo;ve tried those apps that
make you do math before you can cancel the alarm, and I&rsquo;m able to do the math and go back to sleep
without fully waking up in the process (Hey, I&rsquo;m a physics student; math is what we do!).</p>

<p>So I decided to create an alarm clock. Not just any alarm clock, the most overengineered alarm clock
I can think of.</p>

<p>It consists of the Pi connected to a speaker and kept in a hard-to-reach area of the room. The Pi is
on a DHCP network. Every night, I ssh to the Pi, set the volume to full, and run a script which,
using <code>at</code> and <code>mpg123</code>, will schedule jobs to run around the desired time of waking up. First,
there will be a few pieces of soothing music (either violin music or parts of the <em>Interstellar</em>
OST) run once or twice, a while before the time of waking up. Close to the time of waking up, there
are a bunch of jobs where each one will run a string of annoying music. In my case, it&rsquo;s the
Minions&#8217; banana song followed by Nyan Cat (I sometimes add more to this list).</p>

<p>So far so good.</p>

<p>Now, the soothing music gives asleep-me me a chance to surrender and wake up <em>before</em> the Nyan Cat
begins, and often fear of Nyan Cat is a pretty good motivator to wake up. If I don&rsquo;t wake up to
the soft songs, the annoying ones invariably work.</p>

<p>At this stage I&rsquo;m still pretty groggy and have the intense urge to go back to bed. However, turning
off the alarm isn&rsquo;t simple. Since it&rsquo;s in a hard to reach area of the room, I can&rsquo;t just turn it
off. I need to get up, sit in my chair, and turn on the laptop (which is hibernated/suspended), and
kill it via ssh.</p>

<p>This needs me to:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>nmap</code> the network to find the Pi (I&rsquo;m the only one on this subnet who uses <code>ssh</code>, so this just needs a port filter)</li>
<li><code>ssh</code> into the Pi, remembering the password (I haven&rsquo;t done this yet but I could further complicate things by changing the password often to reduce muscle-memory)</li>
<li><code>killall mpg123</code> to kill the currently playing song</li>
<li>Cancel the remaining <code>at</code> jobs. This can be done with <code>atq</code> + <code>atrm</code> for every job (tedious and long), or with <code>awk</code>. If I&rsquo;ve already fully woken up, I&rsquo;m able to do the <code>awk</code> one, otherwise half-asleep me ends up doing the brute-force one, which is enough manual typing to shake the remaining bits of sleepiness off.</li>
</ul>


<p>After this whole process, it&rsquo;s pretty much guaranteed that I&rsquo;m fully awake &ndash; there&rsquo;s no going back now!</p>

<p>So far it&rsquo;s worked pretty well (both when I&rsquo;ve slept on time and when I haven&rsquo;t). If half-asleep me
eventually gets the muscle memory to get past this process, I should probably be able to tweak it
to add more complexity or change the way it works.</p>

<p>Of course, having an arms race with oneself probably isn&rsquo;t the best way to solve this problem. I
suspect I&rsquo;ll go back to regular alarms in a month or so, but it&rsquo;s a fun experiment for now.</p>

<p>However, by the time I&rsquo;m done with this alarm clock, I&rsquo;ll either be waking up on time, or I&rsquo;ll be
able to Linux in my sleep, which is a win-win!</p>

    <link href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/06/26/adventures-in-systems-programming-c-plus-plus-local-statics/"/>

    <id>http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/06/26/adventures-in-systems-programming-c-plus-plus-local-statics</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For a while now I&rsquo;ve been quite interested in compilers and systems programming in general; and I
feel that an important feature of systems programming is that it&rsquo;s relatively easy to figure out
what a line of code does (modulo optimizations) at the OS or hardware level<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Conversely, it&rsquo;s
important to know how your tools work more than ever in systems programming. So when I see a
language feature I&rsquo;m not familiar with, I&rsquo;m interested in finding out how it works under the hood.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a C++ expert. I can work on C++ codebases, but I&rsquo;m not anywhere near knowing all of the
features and nuances of C++. However, I am pretty good at Rust and understand a decent portion of
the compiler internals. This gives me a great perspective &mdash; I&rsquo;ve not yet internalized most C++
features to take them for granted, and I&rsquo;m well equipped to investigate these features.</p>

<p>Today I came across some C++ code similar to the following<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>

<pre><code class="cpp">void foo() {
    static SomeType bar = Env()-&gt;someMethod();
    static OtherType baz = Env()-&gt;otherMethod(bar);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This code piqued my interest. Specifically, the local <code>static</code> stuff. I knew that when you have a
static like</p>

<pre><code>static int FOO = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>the <code>1</code> is stored somewhere in the <code>.data</code> section of the program. This is easily verified with <code>gdb</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="cpp">static int THING = 0xAAAA;

int main() {
 return 1;
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="text">$ g++ test.cpp -g
$ gdb a.out
(gdb) info addr THING
Symbol "THING" is static storage at address 0x601038.
(gdb) info symbol 0x601038
THING in section .data
</code></pre>

<p>This is basically a part of the compiled program as it is loaded into memory.</p>

<p>Similarly, when you have a <code>static</code> that is initialized with a function, it&rsquo;s stored in the <code>.bss</code>
section, and initialized before <code>main()</code>. Again, easily verified:</p>

<pre><code class="cpp">#include&lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int bar() {
 cout&lt;&lt;"bar called\n";
 return 0xFAFAFA;
}

static int THING = bar();

int main() {
 cout&lt;&lt;"main called\n";
 return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="text">$ ./a.out 
bar called
main called
$ gdb a.out
(gdb) info addr THING
Symbol "THING" is static storage at address 0x601198.
(gdb) info symbol 0x601198
THING in section .bss
</code></pre>

<p>We can also leave statics uninitialized (<code>static int THING;</code>) and they will be placed in <code>.bss</code><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>So far so good.</p>

<p>Now back to the original snippet:</p>

<pre><code class="cpp">void foo() {
    static SomeType bar = Env()-&gt;someMethod();
    static OtherType baz = Env()-&gt;otherMethod(bar);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Na√Øvely one might say that these are statics which are scoped locally to avoid name clashes. It&rsquo;s
not much different from <code>static THING = bar()</code> aside from the fact that it isn&rsquo;t a global
identifier.</p>

<p>However, this isn&rsquo;t the case. What tipped me off was that this called <code>Env()</code>, and I wasn&rsquo;t so sure
that the environment was guaranteed to be properly initialized and available before <code>main()</code> is
called <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Instead, these are statics which are initialized the first time the function is called.</p>

<pre><code class="cpp">#include&lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int bar() {
 cout&lt;&lt;"bar called\n";
 return 0xFAFAFA;
}

void foo() {
 cout&lt;&lt;"foo called\n";
 static int i = bar();
 cout&lt;&lt;"Static is:"&lt;&lt; i&lt;&lt;"\n";
}

int main() {
 cout&lt;&lt;"main called\n";
 foo();
 foo();
 foo();
 return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="text">$ g++ test.cpp
$ ./a.out
main called
foo called
bar called
Static is:16448250
foo called
Static is:16448250
foo called
Static is:16448250
</code></pre>

<p>Wait, &ldquo;the first time the function is called&rdquo;? <em>Alarm bells go off&hellip;</em> Surely there&rsquo;s some cost to that! Let&rsquo;s investigate.</p>

<pre><code class="text">$ gdb a.out
(gdb) disas bar
   // snip

   0x0000000000400c9a &lt;+55&gt;:    mov    $0x6021f8,%edi

   0x0000000000400cac &lt;+73&gt;:    mov    $0x6020c0,%edi
   // snip
</code></pre>

<p>The instruction at <code>+44</code> calls <code>bar()</code>, and it seems to be surrounded by calls to some <code>__cxa_guard</code>
functions.</p>

<p>We can take a na√Øve guess at what this does: It probably just sets a hidden static flag on
initialization which ensures that it only runs once.</p>

<p>Of course, the actual solution isn&rsquo;t as simple. It needs to avoid data races, handle errors, and
somehow take care of recursive initialization.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the <a href="http://mentorembedded.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html#once-ctor">spec</a> and one <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/libcppabi/libcppabi-14/src/cxa_guard.cxx">implementation</a>, found by searching for
<code>__cxa_guard</code>.</p>

<p>Both of them show us the generated code for initializing things like local statics:</p>

<pre><code class="cpp">  if (obj_guard.first_byte == 0) {
    if ( __cxa_guard_acquire (&amp;obj_guard) ) {
      try {
      // ... initialize the object ...;
      } catch (...) {
        __cxa_guard_abort (&amp;obj_guard);
        throw;
      }
      // ... queue object destructor with __cxa_atexit() ...;
      __cxa_guard_release (&amp;obj_guard);
    }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>obj_guard</code> is our &ldquo;hidden static flag&rdquo;, with some other extra data.</p>

<p><code>__cxa_guard_acquire</code> and <code>__cxa_guard_release</code> acquire and release a lock to prevent recursive
initialization. So this program will crash:</p>

<pre><code class="cpp">#include&lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

void foo(bool recur);

int bar(bool recur) {
 cout&lt;&lt;"bar called\n";
 if(recur) {
    foo(false);
 }
 return 0xFAFAFA;
}

void foo(bool recur) {
 cout&lt;&lt;"foo called\n";
 static int i = bar(recur);
 cout&lt;&lt;"Static is:"&lt;&lt; i&lt;&lt;"\n";
}



int main() {
 foo(true);
 return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="text">$ g++ test.cpp
$ ./a.out 
foo called
bar called
foo called
terminate called after throwing an instance of '__gnu_cxx::recursive_init_error'
  what():  std::exception
Aborted (core dumped)
</code></pre>

<p>Over here, to initialize <code>i</code>, <code>bar()</code> needs to be called, but <code>bar()</code> calls <code>foo()</code> which needs <code>i</code>
to be initialized, which again will call <code>bar()</code> (though this time it won&rsquo;t recurse). If <code>i</code> wasn&rsquo;t
<code>static</code> it would be fine, but now we have two calls trying to initialize <code>i</code>, and it&rsquo;s unclear as
to which value should be used.</p>

<p>The implementation is pretty interesting. Before looking at the code my quick guess was that the
following would happen for local statics:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>obj_guard</code> is a struct containing a mutex and a flag with three states:
&ldquo;uninitialized&rdquo;, &ldquo;initializing&rdquo;, and &ldquo;initialized&rdquo;. Alternatively, use an atomic state indicator.</li>
<li>When we try to initialize for the first time, the mutex is locked, the flag is set
to &ldquo;initializing&rdquo;, the mutex is released, the value is initialized, and the flag is set to &ldquo;initialized&rdquo;.</li>
<li>If when acquiring the mutex, the value is &ldquo;initialized&rdquo;, don&rsquo;t initialize again</li>
<li>If when acquiring the mutex, the value is &ldquo;initializing&rdquo;, throw some exception</li>
</ul>


<p> (We need the tristate flag because without it recursion would cause deadlocks)</p>

<p>I suppose that this implementation would work, though it&rsquo;s not the one being used. The
<a href="https://github.com/android/platform_bionic/blob/master/libc/bionic/__cxa_guard.cpp">implementation in bionic</a> (the Android version of the C stdlib) is similar; it
uses per-static atomics which indicate various states. However, it does not throw an exception when
we have a recursive initialization, it instead seems to deadlock<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. This is okay because the C++
spec says (<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/open/n2356/stmt.html#stmt.dcl">Section 6.7.4</a>)</p>

<blockquote><p>If control re-enters the declaration (recursively) while the object is being initialized, the
behavior is undefined.</p></blockquote>

<p>However, the implementations in <a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/libsupc%2B%2B/guard.cc">gcc/libstdc++</a> (also <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/libcppabi/libcppabi-14/src/cxa_guard.cxx">this version</a> of
<code>libcppabi</code> from Apple, which is a bit more readable) do something different. They use a global
recursive mutex to handle reentrancy. Recursive mutexes basically can be locked multiple times by a
single thread, but cannot be locked by another thread till the locking thread unlocks them the same
number of times. This means that recursion/reentrancy won&rsquo;t cause deadlocks, but we still have one-
thread-at-a-time access. What these implementations do is:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>guard_object</code> is a set of two flags, one which indicates if the static is initialized,
and one which indicates that the static is being initialized (&ldquo;in use&rdquo;)</li>
<li>If the object is initialized, do nothing (this doesn&rsquo;t use mutexes and is cheap).
This isn&rsquo;t exactly part of the implementation in the library, but is part of the generated code.</li>
<li>If it isn&rsquo;t initialized, acquire the global recursive lock</li>
<li>If the object is initialized by the time the lock was acquired, unlock and return</li>
<li>If not, check if the static is being initialized from the second <code>guard_object</code> flag. If it is
&ldquo;in use&rdquo;, throw an exception.</li>
<li>If it wasn&rsquo;t, mark the second flag of the static&rsquo;s guard object as being &ldquo;in use&rdquo;</li>
<li>Call the initialization function, bubble errors</li>
<li>Unlock the global mutex</li>
<li>Mark the second flag as &ldquo;not in use&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>At any one time, only one thread will be in the process of running initialization routines, due to
the global recursive mutex. Since the mutex is recursive, a function (eg <code>bar()</code>) used for
initializing local statics may itself use (different) local statics. Due to the &ldquo;in use&rdquo; flag, the
initialization of a local static may not recursively call its parent function without causing an
error.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t need per-static atomics, and doesn&rsquo;t deadlock, however it has the cost of a global
mutex which is called at most once per local static. In a highly threaded situation with lots of
such statics, one might want to reevaluate directly using local statics.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/libcxxabi/blob/master/src/cxa_guard.cpp#L188">LLVM&rsquo;s libcxxabi</a> is similar to the <code>libstdc++</code> implementation, but instead of a recursive
mutex it uses a regular mutex (on non-ARM Apple systems) which is unlocked before
<code>__cxa_guard_acquire</code> exits and tests for reentrancy by noting the thread ID in the guard object
instead of the &ldquo;in use&rdquo; flag. Condvars are used for waiting for a thread to stop using an object. On
other platforms, it seems to deadlock, though I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>

<p>So here we have a rather innocent-looking feature that has some hidden costs and pitfalls. But now I
can look at a line of code where this feature is being used, and have a good idea of what&rsquo;s
happening there. One step closer to being a better systems programmer!</p>

    <id>http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/30/how-rust-achieves-thread-safety</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>In every talk I have given till now, the question &ldquo;how does Rust achieve thread safety?&rdquo;
has invariably come up<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I usually just give an overview, but this provides a more comprehensive
explanation for those who are interested</em></p>

<p>See also: <a href="http://huonw.github.io/blog/2015/02/some-notes-on-send-and-sync/">Huon&rsquo;s blog post on the same topic</a></p>

<p>In my <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/27/wrapper-types-in-rust-choosing-your-guarantees/">previous post</a> I touched a bit on the <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html"><code>Copy</code></a> trait. There are other such &ldquo;marker&rdquo; traits
in the standard library, and the ones relevant to this discussion are <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code>Send</code></a> and <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code>Sync</code></a>.
I recommend reading that post if you&rsquo;re not familiar with Rust wrapper types like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html"><code>RefCell</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code>Rc</code></a>,
since I&rsquo;ll be using them as examples throughout this post; but the concepts explained here are largely independent.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this post, I&rsquo;ll restrict thread safety to mean no data races or cross-thread dangling pointers.
Rust doesn&rsquo;t aim to solve race conditions. However, there are projects which utilize the type system to provide
some form of extra safety, for example <a href="https://github.com/Munksgaard/rust-sessions">rust-sessions</a> attempts to
provide protocol safety using session types.</p>

<p>These traits are auto-implemented using a feature called &ldquo;opt in builtin traits&rdquo;. So,
for example, if struct <code>Foo</code> is <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code>Sync</code></a>, all structs containing <code>Foo</code> will
also be <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code>Sync</code></a>, unless we explicitly opt out using <code>impl !Sync for Bar {}</code>. Similarly,
if struct <code>Foo</code> is not <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code>Sync</code></a>, structs containing it will not be <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code>Sync</code></a> either,
unless they explicitly opt in (<code>unsafe impl Sync for Bar {}</code>)</p>

<p>This means that, for example, a <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Sender.html"><code>Sender</code></a> for a <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code>Send</code></a> type is itself <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code>Send</code></a>,
but a <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Sender.html"><code>Sender</code></a> for a non-<code>Send</code> type will not be <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code>Send</code></a>. This pattern is quite powerful;
it lets one use channels with non-threadsafe data in a single-threaded context without
requiring a separate &ldquo;single threaded&rdquo; channel abstraction.</p>

<p>At the same time, structs like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code>Rc</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html"><code>RefCell</code></a> which contain <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code>Send</code></a>/<a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code>Sync</code></a> fields
have explicitly opted out of one or more of these because the invariants they rely on do not
hold in threaded situations.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually possible to design your own library with comparable thread safety guarantees outside
of the compiler &mdash; while these marker traits are specially treated by the compiler, the special
treatment is not necessary for their working. Any two opt-in builtin traits could be used here.</p>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code>Send</code></a> and <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code>Sync</code></a> have slightly differing meanings, but are very intertwined.</p>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code>Send</code></a> types can be moved between threads without an issue. It answers the question
&ldquo;if this variable were moved to another thread, would it still be valid for use?&rdquo;.
Most objects which completely own their contained data qualify here. Notably, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code>Rc</code></a> doesn&rsquo;t
(since it is shared ownership). Another exception is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/thread/struct.LocalKey.html"><code>LocalKey</code></a>, which
<em>does</em> own its data but isn&rsquo;t valid from other threads. Borrowed data does qualify to be <code>Send</code>, but
in most cases it can&rsquo;t be sent across threads due to a constraint that will be touched upon later.</p>

<p>Even though types like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html"><code>RefCell</code></a> use non-atomic reference counting, it can be sent safely
between threads because this is a transfer of <em>ownership</em> (a move). Sending a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html"><code>RefCell</code></a> to another thread
will be a move and will make it unusable from the original thread; so this is fine.</p>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code>Sync</code></a>, on the other hand, is about synchronous access. It answers the question: &ldquo;if
multiple threads were all trying to access this data, would it be safe?&rdquo;. Types like
<a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html"><code>Mutex</code></a> and other lock/atomic based types implement this, along with primitive types.
Things containing pointers generally are not <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code>Sync</code></a>.</p>

<p><code>Sync</code> is sort of a crutch to <code>Send</code>; it helps make other types <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code>Send</code></a> when sharing is
involved. For example, <code>&amp;T</code> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code></a> are only <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code>Send</code></a> when the inner data is <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code>Sync</code></a> (there&rsquo;s an additional
<a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code>Send</code></a> bound in the case of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code></a>). In words, stuff that has shared/borrowed ownership can be sent
to another thread if the shared/borrowed data is synchronous-safe.</p>

<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html"><code>RefCell</code></a>, while <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code>Send</code></a>, is not <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code>Sync</code></a> because of the non atomic reference counting.</p>

<p>Bringing it together, the gatekeeper for all this is <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.spawn.html"><code>thread::spawn()</code></a>. It has the signature</p>

<pre><code class="rust">pub fn spawn&lt;F, T&gt;(f: F) -&gt; JoinHandle&lt;T&gt; where F: FnOnce() -&gt; T, F: Send + 'static, T: Send + 'static
</code></pre>

<p>Admittedly, this is confusing/noisy, partially because it&rsquo;s allowed to return a value, and also because
it returns a handle from which we can block on a thread join. We can conjure a simpler <code>spawn</code> API for our needs though:</p>

<pre><code class="rust">pub fn spawn&lt;F&gt;(f: F) where F: FnOnce(), F: Send + 'static
</code></pre>

<p>which can be called like:</p>

<pre><code class="rust">let mut x = vec![1,2,3,4];

// `move` instructs the closure to move out of its environment
thread::spawn(move || {
   x.push(1);

});

// x is not accessible here since it was moved
</code></pre>

<p>In words, <code>spawn()</code> will take a callable (usually a closure) that will be called once, and contains
data which is <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code>Send</code></a> and <code>'static</code>. Here, <code>'static</code> just means that there is no borrowed
data contained in the closure. This is the aforementioned constraint that prevents the sharing of
borrowed data across threads; without it we would be able to send a borrowed pointer to a thread that
could easily outlive the borrow, causing safety issues.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a slight nuance here about the closures &mdash; closures can capture outer variables,
but by default they do so by-reference (hence the <code>move</code> keyword). They autoimplement <code>Send</code>
and <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code>Sync</code></a> depending on their capture clauses. For more on their internal representation,
see <a href="http://huonw.github.io/blog/2015/05/finding-closure-in-rust/">huon&rsquo;s post</a>. In this case, <code>x</code> was captured by-move; i.e. as <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html"><code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code></a>
(instead of being similar to <code>&amp;Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> or something), so the closure itself can be <code>Send</code>.
Without the <code>move</code> keyword, the closure would not be `&lsquo;static&rsquo; since it contains borrowed
content.</p>

<p>Since the closure inherits the <code>Send</code>/<code>Sync</code>/<code>'static</code>-ness of its captured data, a closure
capturing data of the correct type will satisfy the <code>F: Send+'static</code> bound.</p>

<p>Some examples of things that are allowed and not allowed by this function (for the type of <code>x</code>):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html"><code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code></a>, <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html"><code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code></a> are allowed because they are <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code>Send</code></a> and <code>'static</code> (when the inner type is of the same kind)</li>
<li><code>&amp;T</code> isn&rsquo;t allowed because it&rsquo;s not <code>'static</code>. This is good, because borrows should have a statically-known lifetime. Sending a borrowed pointer to a thread may lead to a use after free, or otherwise break aliasing rules.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code></a> isn&rsquo;t <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code>Send</code></a>, so it isn&rsquo;t allowed. We could have some other <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code></a>s hanging around, and end up with a data race on the refcount.</li>
<li><code>Arc&lt;Vec&lt;u32&gt;&gt;</code> is allowed (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html"><code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code></a> is <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code>Send</code></a> and <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code>Sync</code></a> if the inner type is); we can&rsquo;t cause a safety violation here. Iterator invalidation requires mutation, and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code></a> doesn&rsquo;t provide this by default.</li>
<li><code>Arc&lt;Cell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> isn&rsquo;t allowed. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.Cell.html"><code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code></a> provides copying-based internal mutability, and isn&rsquo;t <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code>Sync</code></a> (so the <code>Arc&lt;Cell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> isn&rsquo;t <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"><code>Send</code></a>). If this were allowed, we could have cases where larger structs are getting written to from different threads simultaneously resulting in some random mishmash of the two. In other words, a data race.</li>
<li><code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> or <code>Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> are allowed (for <code>Send</code> <code>T</code>). The inner types use threadsafe locks and provide lock-based internal mutability. They can guarantee that only one thread is writing to them at any point in time. For this reason, the mutexes are <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code>Sync</code></a> regardless of the inner <code>T</code> (as long as it is <code>Send</code>), and <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code>Sync</code></a> types can be shared safely with wrappers like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code>Arc</code></a>. From the point of view of the inner type, it&rsquo;s only being accessed by one thread at a time (slightly more complex in the case of <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.RwLock.html"><code>RwLock</code></a>), so it doesn&rsquo;t need to know about the threads involved. There can&rsquo;t be data races when <code>Sync</code> types like these are involved.</li>
</ul>


<p>As mentioned before, you can in fact create a <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Sender.html"><code>Sender</code></a>/<a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Receiver.html"><code>Receiver</code></a> pair of non-<code>Send</code> objects. This sounds a bit
counterintuitive &mdash; shouldn&rsquo;t we be only sending values which are <code>Send</code>? However, <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Sender.html"><code>Sender&lt;T&gt;</code></a> is only
<code>Send</code> if <code>T</code> is <code>Send</code>; so even if we can use a <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Sender.html"><code>Sender</code></a> of a non-<code>Send</code> type, we cannot send it to another thread,
so it cannot be used to violate thread safety.</p>

<p>There is also a way to utilize the <code>Send</code>-ness of <code>&amp;T</code> (which is not <code>'static</code>) for some <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"><code>Sync</code></a> <code>T</code>, namely <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.scoped.html"><code>thread::scoped</code></a>.
This function does not have the <code>'static</code> bound, but it instead has an RAII guard which forces a join before the borrow ends. This
allows for easy fork-join parallelism without necessarily needing a <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html"><code>Mutex</code></a>.
Sadly, there <a href="http://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/everyone-peaches/">are</a> <a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2015/04/29/on-reference-counting-and-leaks/">problems</a> which crop up when this interacts with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code>Rc</code></a> cycles, so the API
is currently unstable and will be redesigned. This is not a problem with the language design or the design of <code>Send</code>/<code>Sync</code>,
rather it is a perfect storm of small design inconsistencies in the libraries.</p>

    <updated>2015-05-28T07:48:53+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/28/github-streak-end-game-and-post-mortem</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>More than a <a href="http://inpursuitoflaziness.blogspot.in/2014/02/50-shades-of-green.html">year ago</a> I blogged (and <a href="http://inpursuitoflaziness.blogspot.in/2014/04/50-more-shades-of-green.html">blogged again</a> later) about my
<a href="https://github.com/Manishearth">ongoing github streak</a>.</p>

<p>The GitHub streak has since gone on for more than 500 days<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and has been a really enriching experience.</p>

<p>Yesterday; I noticed something. I had reached end-game with this exercise. The streak is something I don&rsquo;t think about anymore,
and I don&rsquo;t make any efforts to keep it going. It just &hellip; happens. My involvement in open source has reached a level where
I don&rsquo;t need to consciously try contributing daily; I have enough interests/responsibilities that the streak is a side effect. This is despite
my current internship being at a place where the code I&rsquo;m working on is not hosted on GitHub (unlike last year). If the streak breaks, I won&rsquo;t
particularly care; and I <em>haven&rsquo;t</em> been caring for a while now.</p>

<p>&hellip; I think that&rsquo;s amazing. Despite me not realizing it at the time, this is the state of affairs that such an exercise would ideally
lead to &mdash; the initial motivation for the exercise replaced with something more substantial, until the excercise is no longer relevant.</p>

<p>I initially started this off after realizing that I had inadvertantly been contributing daily to open source for a week or so. In the past, my
contributions to open source used to be in bursts, which meant that I would be out of touch at times. I decided to try and work on extending this.
After around 30 days, I had a concrete habit. After around 40, I realized that I&rsquo;d become much more efficient at working on random bugs (even in unfamiliar codebases),
thus being able to spend more time writing real code.</p>

<p>Initially I had set a bunch of rules (listed in my <a href="http://inpursuitoflaziness.blogspot.in/2014/02/50-shades-of-green.html">original post</a>), which had stuff like issues/readme edits not counting (and no date manipulation!). I tweaked the rules around the 80-mark
to include issues/readmes when I had written code that day but it was lost in a commit squash or rebase. I think much later I dropped the rules about issues and readme edits entirely;
just considering &ldquo;anything that shows up on the punchcard which is not a result of date manipulation&rdquo; to be valid. At that point I was already quite involved in multiple projects
and didn&rsquo;t care so much about the streak or the original rules &mdash; it was just a habit at that point.</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;m a regular contributor to both the <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">Servo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust">Rust</a> projects. I also have a bunch of personal projects (<a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy">some</a> <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-tenacious">lints</a> <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-extensible">and</a> <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-adorn">syntax extensions</a> for Rust, as well as a <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-gc/">gc</a>, along with a lot of older projects that I don&rsquo;t actively work on but maintain) and am trying to regularly blog. I&rsquo;ve
also gotten well into the habit of sending pull requests for fixing mistakes or annoyances. When all this comes together, I end up with at least one contribution a day. Sometimes more.
I have tons of things queued that I want to work on (both personal and as a part of Servo/Rust/elsewhere), if only I had the time.</p>

<p>If you do have enough spare time, I do recommend trying this. Once you get enough momentum the power of habit will keep it going, and if
my case is anything of an indicator<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> you&rsquo;ll eventually have a good chunk of contributions and some concrete open source involvement.</p>

<p>Please note that GitHub streaks shouldn&rsquo;t be used as a metric, <em>ever</em>. They&rsquo;re great for self motivation. As a metric for tracking employee performance,
or for filtering interview candidates; not so much. It&rsquo;s way too rough a metric (like LoC written), and oversimplifies the work that goes into code.
As far as using it to boost interview candidates; not everyone has the time or inclination to contribute to open source after a day job in programming,
and <em>that&rsquo;s okay</em>. I&rsquo;m a physics student &mdash; programming is like a hobby for me<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> which I&rsquo;ll gladly do daily. Now that I have a programming intern,
I&rsquo;m pretty sure there will be days where I don&rsquo;t want to program further after leaving the office.</p>

<p>The punchcard on GitHub only shows 400-something because the streak got retroactively broken by some deletion or rebase &mdash; at that point I didn&rsquo;t care enough to investigate<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

    <link href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/27/wrapper-types-in-rust-choosing-your-guarantees/"/>
    <updated>2015-05-27T20:29:59+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/27/wrapper-types-in-rust-choosing-your-guarantees</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is now <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/choosing-your-guarantees.html">a part of the official rust book</a></em></p>

<p>In my <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/17/the-problem-with-shared-mutability/">previous post</a> I talked a bit about why the RWlock pattern is important for
accessing data, which is why Rust enforces this pattern either at compile time or runtime
depending on the abstractions used.</p>

<p>It occurred to me that there are many such abstractions in Rust, each with their unique guarantees.
The programmer once again has the choice between runtime and compile time enforcement. It occurred
to me that this plethora of &ldquo;wrapper types&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> could be daunting to newcomers; in this post I intend
to give a thorough explanation of what some prominent ones do and when they should be used.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m assuming the reader knows about <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ownership.html">ownership</a> and <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/references-and-borrowing.html">borrowing</a> in Rust.
Nevertheless, I will attempt to keep the majority of this post accessible to those not yet familiar with these
concepts. Aside from the two links into the book above, <a href="http://blog.skylight.io/rust-means-never-having-to-close-a-socket/">these</a> <a href="http://arthurtw.github.io/2014/11/30/rust-borrow-lifetimes.html">two</a> blog posts cover
the topic in depth.</p>

<h1>Basic pointer types</h1>

<h2><code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code></h2>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html"><code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code></a> is an &ldquo;owned pointer&rdquo; or a &ldquo;box&rdquo;. While it can hand out borrowed references to the data, it is the only
owner of the data. In particular, when something like the following occurs:</p>

<pre><code class="rust">let x = Box::new(1);
let y = x;
// x no longer accessible here
</code></pre>

<p>Here, the box was <em>moved</em> into <code>y</code>. As <code>x</code> no longer owns it,
the compiler will no longer allow the programmer to use <code>x</code> after this. A box
can similarly be moved <em>out</em> of a function by returning, and when a
box (one which hasn&rsquo;t been moved) goes out of scope, destructors are run, deallocating
the inner data.</p>

<p>This abstraction is a low cost abstraction for dynamic allocation. If you want
to allocate some memory on the heap and safely pass a pointer to that memory around, this
is ideal. Note that you will only be allowed to share borrowed references to this by
the regular borrowing rules, checked at compile time.</p>

<h4>Interlude: <code>Copy</code></h4>

<p>Move/ownership semantics are not special to <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>; it is a feature of all types which are not <code>Copy</code>.</p>

<p>A <code>Copy</code> type is one where all the data it logically encompasses (usually, owns) is part of its stack
representation<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.
Most types containing pointers to other data are not <code>Copy</code>, since there is additional data
elsewhere, and simply copying the stack representation may accidentally share ownership of that data
in an unsafe manner.</p>

<p>Types like <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>String</code> which also have data on the heap are also not <code>Copy</code>. Types
like the integer/boolean types are <code>Copy</code></p>

<p><code>&amp;T</code> and raw pointers <em>are</em> <code>Copy</code>. Even though they do point
to further data, they do not &ldquo;own&rdquo; that data. Whereas <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> can be thought of as
&ldquo;some data which happens to be dynamically allocated&rdquo;, <code>&amp;T</code> is thought of as &ldquo;a borrowing reference
to some data&rdquo;. Even though both are pointers, only the first is considered to be &ldquo;data&rdquo;. Hence,
a copy of the first should involve a copy of the data (which is not part of its stack representation),
but a copy of the second only needs a copy of the reference. <code>&amp;mut T</code> is not <code>Copy</code> because mutable aliases
cannot be shared, and <code>&amp;mut T</code> &ldquo;owns&rdquo; the data it points to somewhat since it can mutate.</p>

<p>Practically speaking, a type can be <code>Copy</code> if a copy of its stack representation doesn&rsquo;t violate
memory safety.</p>

<h2><code>&amp;T</code> and <code>&amp;mut T</code></h2>

<p>These are immutable and mutable references respectively. They follow the &ldquo;read-write lock&rdquo; pattern
described in my <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/17/the-problem-with-shared-mutability/">previous post</a>, such that one may either have only one mutable reference
to some data, or any number of immutable ones, but not both. This guarantee is enforced at compile time,
and has no visible cost at runtime. In most cases such pointers suffice for sharing cheap references between
sections of code.</p>

<p>These pointers cannot be copied in such a way that they outlive the lifetime associated with them.</p>

<h2><code>*const T</code> and <code>*mut T</code></h2>

<p>These are C-like raw pointers with no lifetime or ownership attached to them. They just point to some location
in memory with no other restrictions. The only guarantee that these provide is that they cannot be dereferenced
except in code marked <code>unsafe</code>.</p>

<p>These are useful when building safe, low cost abstractions like <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, but should be avoided in safe code.</p>

<h2><code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code></h2>

<p>This is the first wrapper we will cover that has a runtime cost.</p>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code></a> is a reference counted pointer. In other words, this lets us have multiple &ldquo;owning&rdquo; pointers
to the same data, and the data will be freed (destructors will be run) when all pointers are out of scope.</p>

<p>Internally, it contains a shared &ldquo;reference count&rdquo;, which is incremented each time the <code>Rc</code> is cloned, and decremented
each time one of the <code>Rc</code>s goes out of scope. The main responsibility of <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> is to ensure that destructors are called
for shared data.</p>

<p>The internal data here is immutable, and if a cycle of references is created, the data will be leaked. If we want
data that doesn&rsquo;t leak when there are cycles, we need a <em>garbage collector</em>. I do not know of any existing GCs in Rust,
but <a href="http://github.com/Manishearth/rust-gc">I am working on one with Michael Layzell</a> and there&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/fitzgen/rajan-bacon-cc">another cycle collecting one</a> being written by Nick
Fitzgerald.</p>

<h4>Guarantees</h4>

<p>The main guarantee provided here is that the data will not be destroyed until all references to it are out of scope.</p>

<p>This should be used when you wish to dynamically allocate and share some data (read-only) between various portions
of your program, where it is not certain which portion will finish using the pointer last. It&rsquo;s a viable alternative
to <code>&amp;T</code> when <code>&amp;T</code> is either impossible to statically check for correctness, or creates extremely unergonomic code where
the programmer does not wish to spend the development cost of working with.</p>

<p>This pointer is <em>not</em> thread safe, and Rust will not let it be sent or shared with other threads. This lets
one avoid the cost of atomics in situations where they are unnecessary.</p>

<p>There is a sister smart pointer to this one, <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code>. This is a non-owning, but also non-borrowed, smart pointer.
It is also similar to <code>&amp;T</code>, but it is not restricted in lifetime &mdash; a <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code> can be held on to forever. However,
it is possible that an attempt to access the inner data may fail and return <code>None</code>, since this can outlive the owned
<code>Rc</code>s. This is useful for when one wants cyclic data structures and other things.</p>

<h4>Cost</h4>

<p>As far as memory goes, <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> is a single allocation, though it will allocate two extra words as compared to
a regular <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> (for &ldquo;strong&rdquo; and &ldquo;weak&rdquo; refcounts).</p>

<p><code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> has the computational cost of incrementing/decrementing the refcount whenever it is cloned or goes out of
scope respectively. Note that a clone will not do a deep copy, rather it will simply increment the inner reference count
and return a copy of the <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code></p>

<h1>Cell types</h1>

<p>&ldquo;Cells&rdquo; provide interior mutability. In other words, they contain data which can be manipulated even
if the type cannot be obtained in a mutable form (for example, when it is behind an <code>&amp;</code>-ptr or <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>).</p>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/doc/std/cell/">The documentation for the <code>cell</code> module has a pretty good explanation for these</a>.</p>

<p>These types are <em>generally</em> found in struct fields, but they may be found elsewhere too.</p>

<h2><code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code></h2>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/doc/std/cell/struct.Cell.html"><code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code></a> is a type that provides zero-cost interior mutability, but only for <code>Copy</code> types.
Since the compiler knows that all the data owned by the contained value is on the stack, there&rsquo;s
no worry of leaking any data behind references (or worse!) by simply replacing the data.</p>

<p>It is still possible to violate your own invariants using this wrapper, so be careful when
using it. If a field is wrapped in <code>Cell</code>, it&rsquo;s a nice indicator that the chunk of data is mutable
and may not stay the same between the time you first read it and when you intend to use it.</p>

<pre><code class="rust">let x = Cell::new(1);
let y = &amp;x;
let z = &amp;x;
x.set(2);
y.set(3);
z.set(4);
println!("{}", x.get());
</code></pre>

<p>Note that here we were able to mutate the same value from various immutable references.</p>

<p>This has the same runtime cost as the following:</p>

<pre><code class="rust">let mut x = 1;
let y = &amp;mut x;
let z = &amp;mut x;
x = 2;
*y = 3;
*z = 4;
println!("{}", x;
</code></pre>

<p>but it has the added benefit of actually compiling successfully.</p>

<h4>Guarantees</h4>

<p>This relaxes the &ldquo;no aliasing with mutability&rdquo; restriction in places where it&rsquo;s
unnecessary. However, this also relaxes the guarantees that the restriction provides;
so if one&rsquo;s invariants depend on data stored within <code>Cell</code>, one should be careful.</p>

<p>This is useful for mutating primitives and other <code>Copy</code> types when there is no easy way of
doing it in line with the static rules of <code>&amp;</code> and <code>&amp;mut</code>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/378tj6/blog_post_review_requested_container_types/crlfl74">G√°bor Lehel</a> summed up the guarantees provided by <code>Cell</code> in a rather succinct manner:</p>

<blockquote><p>The basic guarantee we need to ensure is that interior references can&rsquo;t be invalidated (left dangling)
by mutation of the outer structure. (Think about references to the interiors of types like <code>Option</code>,
<code>Box</code>, <code>Vec</code>, etc.) <code>&amp;</code>, <code>&amp;mut</code>, and Cell each make a different tradeoff here.
<code>&amp;</code> allows shared interior references but forbids mutation;
<code>&amp;mut</code> allows mutation xor interior references but not sharing;
<code>Cell</code> allows shared mutability but not interior references.</p></blockquote>

<p>[because <code>Cell</code> operates by copying, it can&rsquo;t create interior references]</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/32ypxp/questions_about_mutability/cqfwl3h">This comment by Eddy also touches on the guarantees of <code>Cell</code> and the alternatives</a></p>

<h4>Cost</h4>

<p>There is no runtime cost to using <code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code>, however if one is using it
to wrap larger (<code>Copy</code>) structs, it might be worthwhile to instead wrap individual
fields in <code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code> since each write is a full copy of the struct.</p>

<h2><code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code></h2>

<p><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/doc/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html"><code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code></a> also provides interior mutability, but isn&rsquo;t restricted to <code>Copy</code> types.</p>

<p>Instead, it has a runtime cost. <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> enforces the RWLock pattern at runtime (it&rsquo;s like a single-threaded mutex),
unlike <code>&amp;T</code>/<code>&amp;mut T</code> which do so at compile time. This is done by the <code>borrow()</code> and
<code>borrow_mut()</code> functions, which modify an internal reference count and return smart pointers
which can be dereferenced immutably and mutably respectively. The refcount is restored
when the smart pointers go out of scope. With this system, we can dynamically ensure that
there are never any other borrows active when a mutable borrow is active. If the programmer
attempts to make such a borrow, the thread will panic.</p>

<pre><code class="rust">let x = RefCell::new(vec![1,2,3,4]);
{
    println!("{:?}", *x.borrow())
}

{
    let my_ref = x.borrow_mut();
    my_ref.push(1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Similar to <code>Cell</code>, this is mainly useful for situations where it&rsquo;s hard or impossible to satisfy the
borrow checker. Generally one knows that such mutations won&rsquo;t happen in a nested form, but it&rsquo;s good
to check.</p>

<p>For large, complicated programs, it becomes useful to put some things in <code>RefCell</code>s to
make things simpler. For example, a lot of the maps in <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/middle/ty/struct.ctxt.html">the <code>ctxt</code> struct</a> in the rust compiler
internals are inside this wrapper. These are only modified once (during creation, which is not
right after initialization) or a couple of times in well-separated places. However, since this struct is
pervasively used everywhere, juggling mutable and immutable pointers would be hard (perhaps impossible)
and probably form a soup of <code>&amp;</code>-ptrs which would be hard to extend. On the other hand, the <code>RefCell</code>
provides a cheap (not zero-cost) way of safely accessing these. In the future, if someone adds some code
that attempts to modify the cell when it&rsquo;s already borrowed, it will cause a (usually deterministic) panic
which can be traced back to the offending borrow.</p>

<p>Similarly, in Servo&rsquo;s DOM we have a lot of mutation, most of which is local to a DOM type, but
some of which crisscrosses the DOM and modifies various things. Using <code>RefCell</code> and <code>Cell</code> to guard
all mutation lets us avoid worrying about mutability everywhere, and it simultaneously
highlights the places where mutation is <em>actually</em> happening.</p>

<p>Note that <code>RefCell</code> should be avoided if a mostly simple solution is possible with <code>&amp;</code> pointers.</p>

<h4>Guarantees</h4>

<p><code>RefCell</code> relaxes the <em>static</em> restrictions preventing aliased mutation, and
replaces them with <em>dynamic</em> ones. As such the guarantees have not changed.</p>

<h4>Cost</h4>

<p><code>RefCell</code> does not allocate, but it contains an additional &ldquo;borrow state&rdquo;
indicator (one word in size) along with the data.</p>

<p>At runtime each borrow causes a modification/check of the refcount.</p>

<h1>Synchronous types</h1>

<p>Many of the types above cannot be used in a threadsafe manner. Particularly, <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>,
which both use non-atomic ref counts, cannot be used this way. This makes them cheaper to use, but one
needs thread safe versions of these too. They exist, in the form of <code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code>/<code>RWLock&lt;T&gt;</code></p>

<p>Note that the non-threadsafe types <em>cannot</em> be sent between threads, and this is checked at compile time.
I&rsquo;ll touch on how this is done in a later blog post.</p>

<p>There are many useful wrappers for concurrent programming in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/sync/index.html">sync</a> module, but I&rsquo;m only going to cover
the major ones.</p>

<h2><code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code></h2>

<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code></a> is just a version of <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> that uses an atomic reference count (hence, &ldquo;Arc&rdquo;). This can be sent
freely between threads.</p>

<p>C++&rsquo;s <code>shared_ptr</code> is similar to <code>Arc</code>, however in C++s case the inner data is always mutable. For semantics
similar to that from C++, we should use <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>, or <code>Arc&lt;UnsafeCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> (<code>UnsafeCell&lt;T&gt;</code>
is a cell type that can be used to hold any data and has no runtime cost, but accessing it requires <code>unsafe</code> blocks).
The last one should only be used if one is certain that the usage won&rsquo;t cause any memory unsafety. Remember that
writing to a struct is not an atomic operation, and many functions like <code>vec.push()</code> can reallocate internally
and cause unsafe behavior (so even monotonicity may not be enough to justify <code>UnsafeCell</code>)</p>

<h4>Guarantees</h4>

<p>Like <code>Rc</code>, this provides the (thread safe) guarantee that the destructor for the internal data
will be run when the last <code>Arc</code> goes out of scope (barring any cycles).</p>

<h4>Cost</h4>

<p>This has the added cost of using atomics for changing the refcount (which will happen whenever it is cloned
or goes out of scope). When sharing data from an <code>Arc</code> in
a single thread, it is preferable to share <code>&amp;</code> pointers whenever possible.</p>

<h2><code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>RwLock&lt;T&gt;</code></h2>

<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html"><code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.RwLock.html"><code>RwLock&lt;T&gt;</code></a> provide mutual-exclusion via RAII guards. For both of these, the
mutex is opaque until one calls <code>lock()</code> on it, at which point the thread will
block until a lock can be acquired, and then a guard will be returned. This guard
can be used to access the inner data (mutably), and the lock will be released when the
guard goes out of scope.</p>

<pre><code class="rust">{
    let guard = mutex.lock();
    // guard dereferences mutably to the inner type
    *guard += 1;
} // lock released when destructor runs
</code></pre>

<p><code>RwLock</code> has the added benefit of being efficient for multiple reads. It is always
safe to have multiple readers to shared data as long as there are no writers; and <code>RwLock</code>
lets readers acquire a &ldquo;read lock&rdquo;. Such locks can be acquired concurrently and are kept track of
via a reference count. Writers must obtain a &ldquo;write lock&rdquo; which can only be obtained when all readers
have gone out of scope.</p>

<h4>Guarantees</h4>

<p>Both of these provide safe shared mutability across threads, however they are prone to deadlocks.
Some level of additional protocol safety can be obtained via the type system. An example
of this is <a href="https://github.com/Munksgaard/rust-sessions">rust-sessions</a>, an experimental library which uses session
types for protocol safety.</p>

<h4>Costs</h4>

<p>These use internal atomic-like types to maintain the locks, and these are similar pretty
costly (they can block all memory reads across processors till they&rsquo;re done). Waiting on these locks
can also be slow when there&rsquo;s a lot of concurrent access happening.</p>

<h1>Composition</h1>

<p>A common gripe when reading Rust code is with stuff like <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> and more complicated
compositions of such types.</p>

<p>Usually, it&rsquo;s a case of composing together the guarantees that one needs, without paying for stuff that is
unnecessary.</p>

<p>For example, <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> is one such composition. <code>Rc</code> itself can&rsquo;t be dereferenced mutably;
because <code>Rc</code> provides sharing and shared mutability isn&rsquo;t good, so we put <code>RefCell</code> inside to get
dynamically verified shared mutability. Now we have shared mutable data, but it&rsquo;s shared in a way
that there can only be one mutator (and no readers) or multiple readers.</p>

<p>Now, we can take this a step further, and have <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> or <code>Rc&lt;Vec&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>.
These are both shareable, mutable vectors, but they&rsquo;re not the same.</p>

<p>With the former, the <code>RefCell</code> is wrapping the <code>Vec</code>, so the <code>Vec</code> in its entirety is mutable.
At the same time, there can only be one mutable borrow of the whole <code>Vec</code> at a given time. This
means that your code cannot simultaneously work on different elements of the vector from different
<code>Rc</code> handles. However, we are able to push and pop from the <code>Vec</code> at will. This is similar to an <code>&amp;mut Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>
with the borrow checking done at runtime.</p>

<p>With the latter, the borrowing is of individual elements, but the overall vector is immutable.
Thus, we can independently borrow separate elements, but we cannot push or pop from the vector.
This is similar to an <code>&amp;mut [T]</code><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, but, again, the borrow checking is at runtime.</p>

<p>In concurrent programs, we have a similar situation with <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>, which provides shared
mutability and ownership.</p>

<p>When reading code that uses these, go in step by step and look at the guarantees/costs provided.</p>

<p>When choosing a composed type, we must do the reverse; figure out which guarantees we want, and at which
point of the composition we need them. For example, if there is a choice between <code>Vec&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>,
we should figure out the tradeoffs as done above and pick one.</p>

<p>By &ldquo;stack representation&rdquo; I mean the data on the stack when a value of this type is held on the stack.
