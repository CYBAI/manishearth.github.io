    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A colleague of mine learning Rust had an interesting type / borrow checker error. The solution needs
a less-used feature of Rust (which basically exists precisely for this kind of thing), so I thought
I&rsquo;d document it.</p>

<p>The code was like this:</p>

<pre><code class="rust">let maybe_foo = if some_condition {
    thing.get_ref() // returns Option&lt;&amp;Foo&gt;, borrowed from `thing`
} else {
    thing.get_owned() // returns Option&lt;Foo&gt;
};

use(maybe_foo);
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to follow along, here is a full program that does this (<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=e09a79b511e347fe786e4689d282b806&amp;version=stable&amp;backtrace=0">playpen</a>):</p>

<pre><code class="rust">#[derive(Debug)]
struct Foo;

struct Thingy {
    foo: Foo
}

impl Thingy {
    pub fn get_ref(&amp;self) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;Foo&gt; {
        Some(&amp;self.foo)
    }
    pub fn get_owned(&amp;self) -&gt; Option&lt;Foo&gt; {
        Some(Foo)
    }
    pub fn new() -&gt; Self {
        Thingy {
            foo: Foo
        }
    }
}



pub fn main() {
    let some_condition = true;
    let thing = Thingy::new();

    let maybe_foo = if some_condition {
        thing.get_ref() // returns Option&lt;&amp;Foo&gt;, borrowed from `thing`
    } else {
        thing.get_owned() // returns Option&lt;Foo&gt;
    };

    println!("{:?}", maybe_foo);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m only going to be changing the contents of <code>main()</code> here.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s happening here is that a non-<code>Copy</code> type, <code>Foo</code>, is returned in an <code>Option</code>. In one case,
we have a reference to the <code>Foo</code>, and in another case an owned copy.</p>

<p>We want to set a variable to these, but of course we can&rsquo;t because they&rsquo;re different types.</p>

<p>In one case, we have an owned <code>Foo</code>, and we can usually obtain a borrow from an owned type. For
<code>Option</code>, there&rsquo;s a convenience method <code>.as_ref()</code> that does this<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Let&rsquo;s try using that (<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=41c3f836b9485c216ccb05c257ae5326&amp;version=stable&amp;backtrace=0">playpen</a>):</p>

<pre><code class="rust">let maybe_foo = if some_condition {
    thing.get_ref()
} else {
    thing.get_owned().as_ref()
};
</code></pre>

<p>This will give us an error.</p>

<pre><code>error: borrowed value does not live long enough
  --&gt; &lt;anon&gt;:32:5
   |
31 |         thing.get_owned().as_ref()
   |         ----------------- temporary value created here
32 |     };
   |     ^ temporary value dropped here while still borrowed
...
35 | }
   | - temporary value needs to live until here

error: aborting due to previous error
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is, <code>thing.get_owned()</code> returns an owned value. There&rsquo;s nothing that it gets anchored to
(we don&rsquo;t set its value to a variable), so it is just a temporary &ndash; we can call methods on it, but
once we&rsquo;re done the value will go out of scope.</p>

<p>What we want is something like</p>

<pre><code class="rust">let maybe_foo = if some_condition {
    thing.get_ref()
} else {
    let owned = thing.get_owned();
    owned.as_ref()
};
</code></pre>

<p>but this will still give a borrow error &ndash; <code>owned</code> will still go out of scope within the <code>if</code> block,
and we need the reference to it last as long as <code>maybe_foo</code> (outside the block) is supposed to last.</p>

<p>So this is no good.</p>

<p>An alternate solution here <em>can</em> be copying/cloning the <code>Foo</code> in the <em>first</em> case by calling <code>.map(|x|
x.clone())</code> or <code>.cloned()</code> or something. Sometimes you don&rsquo;t want to clone, so this isn&rsquo;t great.</p>

<p>Another solution here &ndash; the generic advice for dealing with values which may be owned or borrow &ndash;
is to use <code>Cow</code>. It does incur a runtime check, though; one which can be optimized out if things are
inlined enough.</p>

<p>What we need to do here is to extend the lifetime of the temporary returned by <code>thing.get_owned()</code>.
We need to extend it <em>past</em> the scope of the <code>if</code>.</p>

<p>One way to do this is to have an <code>Option</code> outside that scope which we mutate (<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=7868045f2cebec6d23e7a065f5823767&amp;version=stable&amp;backtrace=0">playpen</a>).</p>

<pre><code class="rust">let mut owned = None;
let maybe_foo = if some_condition {
    thing.get_ref()
} else {
    owned = thing.get_owned();
    owned.as_ref()
};
</code></pre>

<p>This works in this case, but in this case we already had an <code>Option</code>. If <code>get_ref()</code> and <code>get_owned()</code>
returned <code>&amp;Foo</code> and <code>Foo</code> respectively, then we&rsquo;d need to do something like:</p>

<pre><code class="rust">let mut owned = None;
let maybe_foo = if some_condition {
    thing.get_ref()
} else {
    owned = Some(thing.get_owned());
    owned.as_ref().unwrap()
};
</code></pre>

<p>which is icky since it introduces an unwrap.</p>

<p>What we really need is a way to signal to the compiler that it needs to hold on to that temporary
for the scope of the enclosing block.</p>

<p>We can do that! (<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=1ddf2a428e73b01baa72acdad7cbbf2b&amp;version=stable&amp;backtrace=0">playpen</a>)</p>

<pre><code class="rust">let owned; // ðŸ˜¯ðŸ˜¯ðŸ˜¯ðŸ˜¯ðŸ˜¯
let maybe_foo = if some_condition {
    thing.get_ref()
} else {
    owned = thing.get_owned();
    owned.as_ref()
};
</code></pre>

<p>We know that Rust doesn&rsquo;t do &ldquo;uninitialized&rdquo; variables. If you want to name a variable, you have to
initialize it. <code>let foo;</code> feels rather like magic in this context, because it looks like we&rsquo;ve declared
an uninitialized variable.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s less well known is that Rust <em>can</em> do &ldquo;deferred&rdquo; initialization. Here, you declare a variable
and can initialize it later, but expressions involving the variable can only exist in branches
where the compiler knows it has been initialized.</p>

<p>This is the case here. We declared the <code>owned</code> variable beforehand. It now lives in the outer scope
and won&rsquo;t be destroyed until the end of the outer scope. However, the variable cannot be used directly
in an expression in the first branch, or after the <code>if</code>. Doing so will give a compile time error
saying <code>use of possibly uninitialized variable: `owned`</code>. We can only use it in the <code>else</code> branch
because the compiler can see that it is unconditionally initialized in that branch.</p>

<p>We can still read the value of <code>owned</code> indirectly through <code>maybe_foo</code> from outside the branch.
This is okay because the storage of <code>owned</code> is guaranteed to live as long as the outer scope,
and <code>maybe_foo</code> borrows from it. The only time <code>maybe_foo</code> is set to a value inside <code>owned</code> is when
<code>owned</code> has been initialized, so it is safe.</p>

    <id>http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2017/04/05/youre-doing-it-wrong</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing it wrong&rdquo;</p>

<p>A common refrain in issue trackers and discussion forums everywhere. In isolation,
it&rsquo;s a variant of RTFM &ndash; give a non-answer when someone wants help, and bounce them
back to a manual or docs which they probably have already read. Not very helpful,
and not useful to anyone. Of course, one can accompany it with a nice explanation
of how to do it right; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing it wrong&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t always a bad thing :)</p>

<p>Especially when it comes to programming languages, but in general in the context of any programming
tool or library, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re doing it wrong&rdquo; is almost always due to a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; mental model. The person, whilst
learning, has built a mental model of how the tool works, but this doesn&rsquo;t accurately reflect
reality. Other times, it does reflect reality, but it does not reflect the mental model of the
maintainers (there can be multiple valid ways of looking at something!),
which leads to an impedance mismatch when reading docs or error messages.</p>

<p>In other cases, &ldquo;doing it wrong&rdquo; is a <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/66377/178438">case of the XY problem</a>, where the user has problem X,
and think they can solve it with solution Y, and end up asking how they can achieve Y. This happens pretty
often &mdash; folks may be approaching your technology with prior experience with related things
that work differently, and may think the same idioms apply.</p>

<p>When I was at <a href="https://maintainerati.org/">WONTFIX</a>, someone who had done support work in the past mentioned that one
thing everyone learns in support is <strong>&ldquo;the user is always wrong &hellip;. and it&rsquo;s not their fault!&rdquo;</strong>.</p>

<p>This is a pretty good template for an attitude to approach &ldquo;doing it wrong&rdquo; questions about your
technology on online forums as well. And this doesn&rsquo;t just benefit the users who ask questions,
this attitude can benefit your technology!</p>

<p>Back when I used to be more active contributing to the Rust compiler, I also used to hang out in
<code>#rust</code> a lot, and often answer newbie questions (now <code>#rust-beginners</code> exists too, and I hang out
in both, but I don&rsquo;t really actively participate as much). One thing I learned to do was probe
deeper into why people hit that confusion in the first place. It&rsquo;s almost always a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; mental
model. Rust is rarely the first programming language folks learn, and people approach it with
preconceptions about how programming works. This isn&rsquo;t unique to Rust, this happens any time someone
learns a language with a different paradigm &mdash; learning C or C++ after doing a GCd language,
learning a functional language after an imperative one, statically typed after dynamic, or one of
the many other axes by which programming languages differ.</p>

<p>Other times, it&rsquo;s just assumptions they made when reading between the lines of whatever resource
they used to learn the language.</p>

<p>So, anyway, folks often have a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; mental model. If we are able to identify that model and correct
it, we have saved that person from potentially getting confused at every step in the future. Great!</p>

<p>With a <em>tiny</em> bit more effort, however, we can do one step better. Not for that person, but for
ourselves! We can probe a bit more and try to understand what caused them to obtain that mental
model. And fix the docs so that it never happens again! Of course, not everyone reads the docs, but
that&rsquo;s what diagnostics are for (in the case of errors). They&rsquo;re a tool to help us nudge the user
towards the right mental model, whilst helping them fix their immediate problem. Rust has for a long
time had pretty great diagnostics, with improvements happening all the time<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I think this is at
least in part due to the attitude of the folks in <code>#rust</code>; always trying to figure out how to
preempt various confusions they see.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a good attitude to have. I hope more folks, both in and out of the Rust community, approach
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing it wrong&rdquo; cases like that.</p>
<div class="footnotes">

<p>Diagnostics issues are often the easiest way to contribute to the compiler itself, so if you want to contribute, I suggest starting there. Willing to mentor!<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Imagine never hearing the phrase &lsquo;INHTPAMA&rsquo; again.</p>

<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s already the case? Bummer.</p>

<p>Often, when talking about Rust, folks refer to the core aliasing rule as &ldquo;that <code>&amp;mut</code> thing&rdquo;,
&ldquo;compile-time <code>RWLock</code>&rdquo; (or &ldquo;compile-time <code>RefCell</code>&rdquo;), or something similar. Basically, referring to
the fact that you can&rsquo;t mutate the data that is currently held via an <code>&amp;</code> reference, and that you
can&rsquo;t mutate or read the data currently held via an <code>&amp;mut</code> reference except through that reference
itself.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s always bugged me that we really don&rsquo;t have a name for this thing. It&rsquo;s one of the core
bits of Rust, and crops up often in discussions.</p>

<p>But we did have a name for it! It was &ldquo;INHTPAMA&rdquo; (which was later butchered into &ldquo;INHTWAMA&rdquo;).</p>

<p>This is a reference to <a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2012/11/18/imagine-never-hearing-the-phrase-aliasable/">Niko&rsquo;s 2012 blog post</a>, titled
&ldquo;Imagine Never Hearing The Phrase &lsquo;aliasable, mutable&rsquo; again&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s where the aliasing
rules came from. Go read it, it&rsquo;s great. It talks about this weird language with at symbols
and purity, but I assure you, that language is Baby Rust. Or maybe Teenage Rust. The
<a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/images/docs/9910_10104/Pg-lifecycle.jpg">lifecycle of rusts is complex and interesting</a> and I don&rsquo;t know how to categorize it.</p>

<p>The point of this post isn&rsquo;t really to encourage reviving the use of &ldquo;INHTWAMA&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s
a rather weird acronym that will probably confuse folks. I would like to have a better
way of refering to &ldquo;that <code>&amp;mut</code> thing&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;d prefer if it wasn&rsquo;t a confusing acronym
that carries no meaning of its own if you don&rsquo;t know the history of it. That&rsquo;s a recipe for
making new community members feel like outsiders.</p>

<p>But that post is amazing and I&rsquo;d hate to see it drop out of the collective
memory of the Rust community.</p>

    <link href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2017/03/05/understanding-git-filter-branch/"/>
    <updated>2017-03-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2017/03/05/understanding-git-filter-branch</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The other day <a href="http://twitter.com/steveklabnik">Steve</a> wanted git alchemy done on the Rust repo.</p>

<p>Specifically, he wanted the reference and nomicon moved out into
their <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/reference">own</a> <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/nomicon">repositories</a>, preserving history. Both situations had some interesting
quirks, the reference has lived in <code>src/doc/reference/*</code> and <code>src/doc/reference.md</code>,
and the nomicon has lived in <code>src/doc/nomicon</code>, <code>src/doc/tarpl</code>, and at the top level
in a separate git root.</p>

<p>As you can guess from the title of this post, the correct tool for this job is <code>git filter-branch</code>.
<a href="https://twitter.com/indygreg">My colleague Greg</a> calls it &ldquo;the swiss-army knife of Git history rewriting&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I had some fun with filter-branch that day, thought I&rsquo;d finally write an accessible tutorial for it. A lot
of folks treat filter-branch like rebase, but it isn&rsquo;t, and this crucial difference can lead to many
false starts. It certainly did for me back when I first learned it.</p>

<p>This kind of ties into the common bit of pedantry about the nature of a commit I keep seeing pop up:</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ManishEarth/status/837203953926352896">Git commits appear to be diffs, but they&rsquo;re actually file copies, but they&rsquo;re actually ACTUALLY diffs.</a></p></blockquote>

<h2>So what is a git commit?</h2>

<p>Generally we interact with git commits via <code>git show</code> or by looking at commits on
a git GUI / web UI. Here, we see diffs. It&rsquo;s natural to think of a commit as a diff,
it&rsquo;s the model that makes the most sense for the most common ways of interacting
with commits. It also makes some sense from an implementation point of view, diffs
seem like an efficient way of storing things.</p>

<p>It turns out that the &ldquo;real&rdquo; model is not this, it&rsquo;s actually that each commit
is a snapshot of the whole repo state at the time.</p>

<p>But actually, it isn&rsquo;t, the underlying implementation does make use of deltas
in packfiles and some other tricks like copy-on-write forking.</p>

<p>Ultimately, arguing about the &ldquo;real&rdquo; mental model is mostly pedantry. There are
multiple ways of looking at a commit. The documentation tends to implicitly think
of them as &ldquo;full copies of the entire file tree&rdquo;, which is where most
of the confusion about <code>filter-branch</code> comes from. But often it&rsquo;s important
to picture them as diffs, too.</p>

<p>Understanding the implementation can be helpful, especially when you break the
repository whilst doing crazy things (I do this often). I&rsquo;ve explained how it works
in a later section, it&rsquo;s not really a prerequisite for understanding filter-branch,
but it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>

<h2>How do I rewrite history with <code>git rebase</code>?</h2>

<p>This is where some of the confusion around <code>filter-branch</code> stems from. Folks have worked with
<code>rebase</code>, and they think <code>filter-branch</code> is a generalized version of this. They&rsquo;re actually quite
different.</p>

<p>For those of you who haven&rsquo;t worked with <code>git rebase</code>, it&rsquo;s a pretty useful way of rewriting
history, and is probably what you should use when you want to rewrite history, especially for
maintaining clean git history in an unmerged under-review branch.</p>

<p>Rebase does a whole bunch of things. Its core task is, given the current branch and a branch that
you want to &ldquo;rebase onto&rdquo;, it will take all commits unique to your branch, and apply them in order
to the new one. Here, &ldquo;apply&rdquo; means &ldquo;apply the diff of the commit, attempting to resolve any conflicts&rdquo;.
At times, it may ask you to manually resolve the conflicts, using the same tooling
you use for conflicts during <code>git merge</code>.</p>

<p>Rebase is much more powerful than that, though. <code>git rebase -i</code> will open up &ldquo;interactive rebase&rdquo;,
which will show you the commits that are going to be rebased. In this interface, you can reorder
commits, mark them for edits (wherein the rebase will stop at that commit and let you <code>git commit
--amend</code> changes into it), and even &ldquo;squash&rdquo; commits which lets you mark a commit to be absorbed
into the previous one. This is rather useful for when you&rsquo;re working on a feature and want to keep
your commits neat, but also want to make fixup patches to older commits. <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/git-fixup-amending-an-older-commit/">Filippo&rsquo;s <code>git fixup</code> alias</a>
packages this particular task into a single git command. Changing <code>EDITOR=true</code> into
<code>EDITOR=: GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=:</code> will make it not even open the editor for confirmation
and try to do the whole thing automatically.</p>

<p><code>git rebase -x some_command</code> is also pretty neat, lets you run a shell command on each step during a rebase.</p>

<p>In this model, you are fundamentally thinking of commits as diffs. When you move around
commits in the interactive rebase editor, you&rsquo;re moving around diffs. When you mark things
for squashing, you&rsquo;re basically merging diffs. The whole process is about taking a set of
diffs and applying them to a different &ldquo;base commit&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/memes/diffs-everywhere.jpg" width="400"></p>

<h2>How do I rewrite history with <code>git filter-branch</code>?</h2>

<p><code>filter-branch</code> does <em>not</em> work with diffs. You&rsquo;re working with the &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; model
of commits here, where each commit is a snapshot of the tree, and rewriting these commits.</p>

<p>What <code>git filter-branch</code> will do is for each commit in the specified branch, apply filters to the
snapshot, and create a new commit. The new commit&rsquo;s parent will be the filtered version of the old
commit&rsquo;s parent. So it creates a parallel commit DAG.</p>

<p>Because the filters apply on the snapshots instead of the diffs, there&rsquo;s no chance for this to cause
conflicts like in git rebase. In git rebase, if I have one commit that makes changes to a file, and
I change the previous commit to just remove the area of the file that was changed, I&rsquo;d have a conflict
and git would ask me to figure out how the changes are supposed to be applied.</p>

<p>In git-filter-branch, if I do this, it will just power through. Unless you explicitly write
your filters to refer to previous commits, the new commit is created in isolation, so it doesn&rsquo;t
worry about changes to the previous commits. If you had indeed edited the previous commit,
the new commit will appear to undo those changes and apply its own on top of that.</p>

<p><code>filter-branch</code> is generally for operations you want to apply pervasively to a repository. If
you just want to tweak a few commits, it won&rsquo;t work, since future commits will appear to undo
your changes. <code>git rebase</code> is for when you want to tweak a few commits.</p>

<p>So, how do you use it?</p>

<p>The basic syntax is <code>git filter-branch &lt;filters&gt; branch_name</code>. You can use <code>HEAD</code> or <code>@</code>
to refer to the current branch instead of explicitly typing <code>branch_name</code>.</p>

<p>A very simple and useful filter is the subdirectory filter. It makes a given subdirectory
the repository root. You use it via <code>git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter name_of_subdir @</code>.
This is useful for extracting the history of a folder into its own repository.</p>

<p>Another useful filter is the tree filter, you can use it to do things like moving around, creating,
or removing files. For example, if you want to move <code>README.md</code> to <code>README</code> in the entire history,
you&rsquo;d do something like <code>git filter-branch --tree-filter 'mv README.md README' @</code> (you can also
achieve this much faster with some manual work and <code>rebase</code>). The tree filter will work by checking
out each commit (in a separate temporary folder), running your filter on the working directory,
adding any changes to the index (no need to <code>git add</code> yourself), and committing the new index.</p>

<p>The <code>--prune-empty</code> argument is useful here, as it removes commits which are now empty due to the
rewrite.</p>

<p>Because it is checking out each commit, this filter is quite slow. When I initially was trying to
do Steve&rsquo;s task on the rust repo, I wrote a long tree filter and it was taking forever.</p>

<p>The faster version is the index filter. However, this is a bit trickier to work with (which is why I
tend to use a tree filter if I can get away with it). What this does is operate on the index,
directly.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;index&rdquo; is basically where things go when you <code>git add</code> them. Running <code>git add</code> will create
temporary objects for the added file, and modify the WIP index (directory tree) to include a
reference to the new file or change an existing file reference to the new one. When you commit, this
index is packaged up into a commit and stored as an object. (More on how these objects work in a
later section)</p>

<p>Now, since this deals with files that are already stored as objects, git doesn&rsquo;t need to unwrap
these objects and create a working directory to operate on them. So, with <code>--index-filter</code>, you
can operate on these in a much faster way. However, since you don&rsquo;t have a working directory,
stuff like adding and moving files can be trickier. You often have to use <code>git update-index</code>
to make this work.</p>

<p>However, a useful index filter is one which just scrubs a file (or files) from history:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">$ git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch filename' HEAD
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>--ignore-unmatch</code> makes the command still succeed if the file doesn&rsquo;t exist. <code>filter-branch</code>
will fail if one of the filters fails. In general I tend to write fallible filters like
<code>command1 1&gt;&amp;2 2&gt;/dev/null ; command2 1&gt;&amp;2 2&gt;/dev/null ; true</code>, which makes it always succeed
and also ignores any stdout/stderr output (which tends to make the progress screen fill up fast).</p>

<p>The <code>--cached</code> argument on <code>git rm</code> makes it operate only on the index, not the working directory.
This is great, because we don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> a working directory right now.</p>

<p>I rarely use <code>git update-index</code> so I&rsquo;m not really going to try and explain how it can be used here.
But if you need to do more complex operations in an index filter, that&rsquo;s the way to go.</p>

<p>There are many other filters, like <code>--commit-filter</code> (lets you discard a commit entirely),
<code>--msg-filter</code> (rewriting commit messages), and <code>--env-filter</code> (changing things like author metadata
or other env vars). You can see a complete list with examples <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-filter-branch">in the docs</a></p>

<h2>How did I perform the rewrites on the reference and nomicon?</h2>

<p>For the Rust Reference, basically I had to extract the history of <code>src/doc/reference.md</code>,
AND <code>src/doc/reference/*</code> (<code>reference.md</code> was split up into <code>reference/*.md</code> recently) into
its own commit. This is an easy tree filter to write, but tree filters take forever.</p>

<p>Instead of trying my luck with an index filter, I decided to just make it so that the
tree filter would be faster. I first extracted <code>src/doc/</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">$ git filter-branch -f --prune-empty --subdirectory-filter src/doc @
</code></pre>

<p>Now I had a branch that contained only the history of <code>src/doc</code>, with the root directory moved to
<code>doc</code>. This is a much smaller repo than the entirety of Rust.</p>

<p>Now, I moved <code>reference.md</code> into <code>reference/</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">$ git filter-branch -f --prune-empty --tree-filter 'mkdir -p reference; mv reference.md reference 1&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null; true' @
</code></pre>

<p>As mentioned before, the <code>/dev/null</code> and <code>true</code> bits are because the mv command will fail in some cases
(when reference.md doesn&rsquo;t exist), and I want it to just continue without complaining when that happens.
I only care about moving instances of that file, if that file doesn&rsquo;t exist there it&rsquo;s still okay.</p>

<p>Now, everything I cared about was within <code>reference</code>. The next step was simple:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">$ git filter-branch -f --prune-empty --subdirectory-filter reference @
</code></pre>

<p>The whole process took maybe 10 minutes to run, most of the time being spent by the second command.
The final result can be found <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/reference">here</a>.</p>

<p>For the nomicon, the task was easier. In the case of the nomicon, it has always resided in
<code>src/doc/nomicon</code>, <code>src/doc/tarpl</code>, or at the root. This last bit is interesting, when
<a href="http://twitter.com/Gankro/">Alexis</a> was working on the nomicon, he started off by hacking on it in a separate repo, but
then within that repo moved it to <code>src/doc/tarpl</code>, and performed a merge commit with rustc. There&rsquo;s
no inherent restriction in Git that all merges must have a common ancestor, and you can do stuff
like this. I was <a href="https://twitter.com/ManishEarth/status/837441118753062912">quite surprised</a> when I saw this, since it&rsquo;s pretty uncommon in general,
but really, many projects of that size will have stuff like this. Servo and html5ever do too, and usually
it&rsquo;s when a large project is merged into it after being developed on the side.</p>

<p>This sounds complicated to work with, but it wasn&rsquo;t that hard. I took the same subdirectory-filtere&rsquo;d
doc directory branch used for the reference. Then, I renamed <code>tarpl/</code> to <code>nomicon/</code> via a tree filter,
and ran another subdirectory filter:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">$ git filter-branch -f --prune-empty --tree-filter 'mv tarpl nomicon 1&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null; true' @
$ git filter-branch -f --prune-empty --subdirectory-filter nomicon @
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I had the whole history of the nomicon in the root dir. Except for the commits made by Alexis
before his frankenmerge, because these got removed in the first subdirectory filter (the commits
were operating outside of <code>src/doc</code>, even though their contents eventually got moved there).</p>

<p>But, at this stage, I already had a branch with the nomicon at the root. Alexis&#8217; original commits
were also operating on the root directory. I can just rebase here, and the diffs of my commits will
cleanly apply!</p>

<p>I found the commit (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/a54e64b3c41103c4f6ab840d8ddd3a56ec6b5da8"><code>a54e64</code></a>) where everything was moved to <code>tarpl/</code>, and took its parent
(<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/c7919f2d9835578321bf7556ad1a01fa42e8a7e8"><code>c7919f</code></a>). Then, I just ran <code>git rebase --root c7919f</code>, and everything cleanly rebased.
As expected, because I had a history going back to the first child of <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/a54e64b3c41103c4f6ab840d8ddd3a56ec6b5da8"><code>a54e64</code></a> with files
moved, and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/a54e64b3c41103c4f6ab840d8ddd3a56ec6b5da8"><code>a54e64</code></a> itself only moved files, so the diffs should cleanly apply.</p>

<p>The final result can be found <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/nomicon">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Appendix: How are commits actually stored?</h2>

<p>The way the actual implementation of a commit works is that each file being stored is hashed and
stored in a compressed format, indexed by the hash. A directory (&ldquo;tree&rdquo;) will be a list of hashes, one for
each file/directory inside it, alongside the filenames and other metadata. This list will be hashed
and used everywhere else to refer to the directory.</p>

<p>A commit will reference the &ldquo;tree&rdquo; object for the root directory via its hash.</p>

<p>Now, if you make a commit changing some files, most of the files will be unchanged. So will most of
the directories. So the commits can share the objects for the unchanged files/directories, reducing
their size. This is basically a copy-on-write model. Furthermore, there&rsquo;s a second optimization
called a &ldquo;packfile&rdquo;, wherein instead of storing a file git will store a delta (a diff) and a
reference to the file the diff must be applied to.</p>

<p>We can see this at work using <code>git cat-file</code>. <code>cat-file</code> lets you view objects in
the &ldquo;git filesystem&rdquo;, which is basically a bunch of hash-indexed objects stored in
<code>.git/objects</code>. You can view them directly by traversing that directory (they&rsquo;re
organized as a trie), but <code>cat-file -p</code> will let you pretty-print their contents
since they&rsquo;re stored in a binary format.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working with <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/book">the repo for the Rust Book</a>,
playing with commit <a href="4822f2baa69c849e4fa3b85204f219a16bde2f42"><code>4822f2</code></a>. It&rsquo;s a commit that changes
just one file (<code>second-edition/src/ch15-01-box.md</code>), perfect.</p>

<p>As you can see, only the file that was changed in the commit has a new blob stored.
If you view <code>14c553</code> and <code>29d879</code> you&rsquo;ll get the pre- and post- commit versions
of the file respectively.</p>

<p>So basically, each commit stores a tree of references to objects, often sharing nodes
with other commits.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t had the opportunity to work with packfiles much, but they&rsquo;re an
additional optimization on top of this. <a href="https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/three/unpacking-git-packfiles">Aditya&rsquo;s post</a> is a good
intro to these.</p>
