  <div class="entry-content"><p>Whose words are these I think I know<br>
His house is in the village though<br>
He will not see me stopping here<br>
To interpret his work as I go<br></p>

<p>My little student must think it queer<br>
To read without some context near<br>
Between the words and the intent<br>
He wonders what the poem meant<br></p>

<p>He gives his head a little shake<br>
To ask if there is some mistake<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what the author said!&rdquo;<br>
Providing another view instead<br></p>

<p>The words are lovely, dark, and deep<br>
But I have literary criticism to preach<br>
And miles to go before I sleep<br>
And miles to go before I sleep<br></p>

<p><br><br><br><br><br></p>

<p>Seriously though, try reading <em>The Road Not Taken</em> as metacircular commentary on how the poem
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_Not_Taken#Analysis">is very often &ldquo;mis&#8221;interpreted</a>, and the nature of interpretation / <em>Death of the Author</em>. It fits perfectly when
you read &ldquo;road&rdquo; as &ldquo;interpretation&rdquo;.</p>

<p><small>(Yes, I know, the parody above is not based on <em>The Road Not Taken</em> but instead a different Frost
poem. I was originally going to modify <em>The Road Not Taken</em> but realized all I had to do was change
a few words to get there, which was no fun at all) </small></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m only going to be changing the contents of <code>main()</code> here.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s happening here is that a non-<code>Copy</code> type, <code>Foo</code>, is returned in an <code>Option</code>. In one case,
we have a reference to the <code>Foo</code>, and in another case an owned copy.</p>

<p>We want to set a variable to these, but of course we can&rsquo;t because they&rsquo;re different types.</p>

<p>In one case, we have an owned <code>Foo</code>, and we can usually obtain a borrow from an owned type. For
<code>Option</code>, there&rsquo;s a convenience method <code>.as_ref()</code> that does this<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Let&rsquo;s try using that (<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=41c3f836b9485c216ccb05c257ae5326&amp;version=stable&amp;backtrace=0">playpen</a>):</p>

<p>The problem is, <code>thing.get_owned()</code> returns an owned value. There&rsquo;s nothing that it gets anchored to
(we don&rsquo;t set its value to a variable), so it is just a temporary &ndash; we can call methods on it, but
once we&rsquo;re done the value will go out of scope.</p>

<p>What we want is something like</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">thing</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">get_ref</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="n">owned</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">thing</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">get_owned</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">owned</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">as_ref</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">};</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>but this will still give a borrow error &ndash; <code>owned</code> will still go out of scope within the <code>if</code> block,
and we need the reference to it last as long as <code>maybe_foo</code> (outside the block) is supposed to last.</p>

<p>So this is no good.</p>

<p>An alternate solution here <em>can</em> be copying/cloning the <code>Foo</code> in the <em>first</em> case by calling <code>.map(|x|
x.clone())</code> or <code>.cloned()</code> or something. Sometimes you don&rsquo;t want to clone, so this isn&rsquo;t great.</p>

<p>Another solution here &ndash; the generic advice for dealing with values which may be owned or borrow &ndash;
is to use <code>Cow</code>. It does incur a runtime check, though; one which can be optimized out if things are
inlined enough.</p>

<p>What we need to do here is to extend the lifetime of the temporary returned by <code>thing.get_owned()</code>.
We need to extend it <em>past</em> the scope of the <code>if</code>.</p>

<p>One way to do this is to have an <code>Option</code> outside that scope which we mutate (<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=7868045f2cebec6d23e7a065f5823767&amp;version=stable&amp;backtrace=0">playpen</a>).</p>

<p>This works in this case, but in this case we already had an <code>Option</code>. If <code>get_ref()</code> and <code>get_owned()</code>

<p>which is icky since it introduces an unwrap.</p>

<p>What we really need is a way to signal to the compiler that it needs to hold on to that temporary

<p>We know that Rust doesn&rsquo;t do &ldquo;uninitialized&rdquo; variables. If you want to name a variable, you have to
initialize it. <code>let foo;</code> feels rather like magic in this context, because it looks like we&rsquo;ve declared
an uninitialized variable.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s less well known is that Rust <em>can</em> do &ldquo;deferred&rdquo; initialization. Here, you declare a variable
and can initialize it later, but expressions involving the variable can only exist in branches
where the compiler knows it has been initialized.</p>

<p>This is the case here. We declared the <code>owned</code> variable beforehand. It now lives in the outer scope
and won&rsquo;t be destroyed until the end of the outer scope. However, the variable cannot be used directly
in an expression in the first branch, or after the <code>if</code>. Doing so will give a compile time error
saying <code>use of possibly uninitialized variable: `owned`</code>. We can only use it in the <code>else</code> branch
because the compiler can see that it is unconditionally initialized in that branch.</p>

<p>We can still read the value of <code>owned</code> indirectly through <code>maybe_foo</code> from outside the branch.
This is okay because the storage of <code>owned</code> is guaranteed to live as long as the outer scope,
and <code>maybe_foo</code> borrows from it. The only time <code>maybe_foo</code> is set to a value inside <code>owned</code> is when
<code>owned</code> has been initialized, so it is safe.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing it wrong&rdquo;</p>

<p>A common refrain in issue trackers and discussion forums everywhere. In isolation,
it&rsquo;s a variant of RTFM &ndash; give a non-answer when someone wants help, and bounce them
back to a manual or docs which they probably have already read. Not very helpful,
and not useful to anyone. Of course, one can accompany it with a nice explanation
of how to do it right; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing it wrong&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t always a bad thing :)</p>

<p>Especially when it comes to programming languages, but in general in the context of any programming
tool or library, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re doing it wrong&rdquo; is almost always due to a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; mental model. The person, whilst
learning, has built a mental model of how the tool works, but this doesn&rsquo;t accurately reflect
reality. Other times, it does reflect reality, but it does not reflect the mental model of the
maintainers (there can be multiple valid ways of looking at something!),
which leads to an impedance mismatch when reading docs or error messages.</p>

<p>In other cases, &ldquo;doing it wrong&rdquo; is a <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/66377/178438">case of the XY problem</a>, where the user has problem X,
and think they can solve it with solution Y, and end up asking how they can achieve Y. This happens pretty
often &mdash; folks may be approaching your technology with prior experience with related things
that work differently, and may think the same idioms apply.</p>

<p>When I was at <a href="https://maintainerati.org/">WONTFIX</a>, someone who had done support work in the past mentioned that one
thing everyone learns in support is <strong>&ldquo;the user is always wrong &hellip;. and it&rsquo;s not their fault!&rdquo;</strong>.</p>

<p>This is a pretty good template for an attitude to approach &ldquo;doing it wrong&rdquo; questions about your
technology on online forums as well. And this doesn&rsquo;t just benefit the users who ask questions,
this attitude can benefit your technology!</p>

<p>Back when I used to be more active contributing to the Rust compiler, I also used to hang out in
<code>#rust</code> a lot, and often answer newbie questions (now <code>#rust-beginners</code> exists too, and I hang out
in both, but I don&rsquo;t really actively participate as much). One thing I learned to do was probe
deeper into why people hit that confusion in the first place. It&rsquo;s almost always a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; mental
model. Rust is rarely the first programming language folks learn, and people approach it with
preconceptions about how programming works. This isn&rsquo;t unique to Rust, this happens any time someone
learns a language with a different paradigm &mdash; learning C or C++ after doing a GCd language,
learning a functional language after an imperative one, statically typed after dynamic, or one of
the many other axes by which programming languages differ.</p>

<p>Other times, it&rsquo;s just assumptions they made when reading between the lines of whatever resource
they used to learn the language.</p>

<p>So, anyway, folks often have a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; mental model. If we are able to identify that model and correct
it, we have saved that person from potentially getting confused at every step in the future. Great!</p>

<p>With a <em>tiny</em> bit more effort, however, we can do one step better. Not for that person, but for
ourselves! We can probe a bit more and try to understand what caused them to obtain that mental
model. And fix the docs so that it never happens again! Of course, not everyone reads the docs, but
that&rsquo;s what diagnostics are for (in the case of errors). They&rsquo;re a tool to help us nudge the user
towards the right mental model, whilst helping them fix their immediate problem. Rust has for a long
time had pretty great diagnostics, with improvements happening all the time<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I think this is at
least in part due to the attitude of the folks in <code>#rust</code>; always trying to figure out how to
preempt various confusions they see.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a good attitude to have. I hope more folks, both in and out of the Rust community, approach
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing it wrong&rdquo; cases like that.</p>
<div class="footnotes">

<p>Diagnostics issues are often the easiest way to contribute to the compiler itself, so if you want to contribute, I suggest starting there. Willing to mentor!<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Imagine never hearing the phrase &lsquo;INHTPAMA&rsquo; again.</p>

<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s already the case? Bummer.</p>

<p>Often, when talking about Rust, folks refer to the core aliasing rule as &ldquo;that <code>&amp;mut</code> thing&rdquo;,
&ldquo;compile-time <code>RWLock</code>&rdquo; (or &ldquo;compile-time <code>RefCell</code>&rdquo;), or something similar. Basically, referring to
the fact that you can&rsquo;t mutate the data that is currently held via an <code>&amp;</code> reference, and that you
can&rsquo;t mutate or read the data currently held via an <code>&amp;mut</code> reference except through that reference
itself.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s always bugged me that we really don&rsquo;t have a name for this thing. It&rsquo;s one of the core
bits of Rust, and crops up often in discussions.</p>

<p>But we did have a name for it! It was &ldquo;INHTPAMA&rdquo; (which was later butchered into &ldquo;INHTWAMA&rdquo;).</p>

<p>This is a reference to <a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2012/11/18/imagine-never-hearing-the-phrase-aliasable/">Niko&rsquo;s 2012 blog post</a>, titled
&ldquo;Imagine Never Hearing The Phrase &lsquo;aliasable, mutable&rsquo; again&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s where the aliasing
rules came from. Go read it, it&rsquo;s great. It talks about this weird language with at symbols
and purity, but I assure you, that language is Baby Rust. Or maybe Teenage Rust. The
<a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/images/docs/9910_10104/Pg-lifecycle.jpg">lifecycle of rusts is complex and interesting</a> and I don&rsquo;t know how to categorize it.</p>

<p>The point of this post isn&rsquo;t really to encourage reviving the use of &ldquo;INHTWAMA&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s
a rather weird acronym that will probably confuse folks. I would like to have a better
way of refering to &ldquo;that <code>&amp;mut</code> thing&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;d prefer if it wasn&rsquo;t a confusing acronym
that carries no meaning of its own if you don&rsquo;t know the history of it. That&rsquo;s a recipe for
making new community members feel like outsiders.</p>

<p>But that post is amazing and I&rsquo;d hate to see it drop out of the collective
memory of the Rust community.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write about physics for a while. When I started this blog the intention was to
write about a wide variety of interests, but I ended up focusing on programming, despite the fact
that I was doing more physics than programming for most of the lifetime of this blog. Time to change
that, and hopefully write about other non-programming topics too.</em></p>

<p>Quantum Computing. It&rsquo;s the new hip thing that&rsquo;s going to change the world<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Someday.</p>

<p>In it&rsquo;s essence, where classical computing deals with &ldquo;bits&rdquo;, which are on/off states, quantum
computing deals with &ldquo;qubits&rdquo;, which are probabalistic quantum states that are often a mixture of on
and off. These have interesting properties which make certain kinds of so-far-hard computation very
easy to perform.</p>

<p>The goal of this post is not to teach quantum computing, rather to garner interest. I come to praise
quantum computing, not bury it<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. As a result, this post doesn&rsquo;t require a background in physics.
Having worked with very simple logic circuits is probably enough, though you may not even need that.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m basically going to sketch out an example of a very simple quantum algorithm. One that&rsquo;s very
logic-defying. It&rsquo;s even logic-defying for many who have studied quantum mechanics; it certainly
was for me. When I learned this first I could understand <em>why</em> it worked but there was a lot of
dissonance between that and my intuitive conviction that it was <em>wrong</em>.</p>

<h2>The algorithm</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/deutsch/deutsch-jozsa.png" width="600"></p>

<p>This is a quantum circuit (specifically, the circuit for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch%E2%80%93Jozsa_algorithm">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>).
It&rsquo;s used to find out the nature of a black-box function <code>f(x)</code>, which takes in one qubit and outputs
another<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. For now, you can try to interpret this circuit as if it were a regular logic circuit.
You&rsquo;ll soon see that this interpretation is wrong, but it&rsquo;s useful for the purposes of this explanation.</p>

<p>To run this algorithm, you first construct an &ldquo;oracle&rdquo; out of the black-box function. The oracle,
given inputs <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, has outputs <code>x</code> and <code>y ⊕ f(x)</code> (where <code>⊕</code> is the symbol for XOR, the
&ldquo;exclusive OR&rdquo;).</p>

<p>As with logic circuits, data flow here goes from left to right. This circuit has two constant
inputs, a zero and a one. This is similar to how we might have constant &ldquo;true&rdquo; and &ldquo;false&rdquo; inputs
to logic circuits.</p>

<p>They are then passed through &ldquo;Hadamard gates&rdquo;. These are <em>like</em> NOT gates, in that applying them
twice is a no-op (they are their own inverse), but they&rsquo;re not actually NOT gates. I like to
describe them as &ldquo;sideways NOT gates&rdquo; since that description somewhat intuitively captures what&rsquo;s
going on with the qubits. What&rsquo;s important to note here is that they have one input and one
output, so they&rsquo;re unaffected by the goings-on in a different wire.</p>

<p>Once these inputs have been Hadamard&#8217;ed, they are fed to the oracle we constructed. The top input
goes on to become the top output. It&rsquo;s also passed through <code>f(x)</code> and XORd with the bottom input to make
the bottom output.</p>

<p>The top output is then Hadamard&#8217;ed again, and finally we observe its value.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s where the magic comes in. By observing the top output, <em>we will know the nature of <code>f(x)</code></em><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Wait, what? The top output doesn&rsquo;t appear to have any interaction with <code>f(x)</code> at all! How can that work?</p>

<p>In fact, we could try to rewrite this circuit such that the measured output definitely has no interaction with
<code>f(x)</code> whatever, assuming that the Hadamard gate isn&rsquo;t doing anything funky<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> (it isn&rsquo;t):</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/deutsch/deutsch-jozsa-wrong.png" width="600"></p>

<p>How in the world does this work?</p>

<h2>Why it works</h2>

<p>Sadly, I can&rsquo;t give a satisfying explanation to <em>exactly</em> why this works. This requires some quantum mechanics
background<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> to grasp.</p>

<p>However, I can give a hopefully-satisfying explanation as to why our regular intuition doesn&rsquo;t work here.</p>

<p>First and foremost: The rewritten circuit I showed above? It&rsquo;s wrong. If this was a logic circuit, we could always do that,
but in quantum computing, T-junctions like the following can&rsquo;t exist:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/deutsch/deutsch-jozsa-tjunction.png" width="600"></p>

<p>This is due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-cloning_theorem">&ldquo;No Cloning theorem&rdquo;</a>. Unlike regular logic circuits, you can&rsquo;t
just &ldquo;duplicate&rdquo; a qubit. In some cases (like this one), you can try to create a similar qubit
via the same process (e.g. here we could take another 0 and pass it through a Hadamard gate), but
it&rsquo;s not the &ldquo;same&rdquo; qubit. Unlike bits, qubits have a stronger notion of unique identity.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s this sense of identity that fuels this algorithm (and most of quantum computing).</p>

<p>You see, while the top output of the oracle was <code>x</code>, it wasn&rsquo;t exactly the <em>same</em> <code>x</code>. This <code>x</code> had
been mixed with the lower output. This means that the upper and lower outputs are now <em>entangled</em>,
with their state depending on each other. In fact, it&rsquo;s really misleading to show the output as two
wires in the first place &ndash; it&rsquo;s really a single &ldquo;entangled&rdquo; state of two qubits that can&rsquo;t be
decomposed as a &ldquo;top half&rdquo; and a &ldquo;bottom half&rdquo;. Of course, this way of representing quantum circuits
is still used because it&rsquo;s a tidy way of visualizing these circuits, and physicists are aware of the
caveats involved.</p>

<p>So what happens is that when you observe the top output, you are really doing a partial observation
on the combined state of the two outputs, and this includes some information about <code>f(x)</code>, which
leaks out when you perform the observation.</p>

<p>These properties of qubits make quantum circuits work significantly differently from regular logic
ones. On one hand, this severely restricts what you can do with them, but at the same time, new
avenues of erstwhile-impossible operations open up. Most useful quantum algorithms (like Shor&rsquo;s
factorization algorithm) involve a mixture of a classical algorithm and a quantum circuit due to
this reason. It&rsquo;s pretty cool!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The other day <a href="http://twitter.com/steveklabnik">Steve</a> wanted git alchemy done on the Rust repo.</p>

<p>Specifically, he wanted the reference and nomicon moved out into
their <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/reference">own</a> <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/nomicon">repositories</a>, preserving history. Both situations had some interesting
quirks, the reference has lived in <code>src/doc/reference/*</code> and <code>src/doc/reference.md</code>,
and the nomicon has lived in <code>src/doc/nomicon</code>, <code>src/doc/tarpl</code>, and at the top level
in a separate git root.</p>

<p>As you can guess from the title of this post, the correct tool for this job is <code>git filter-branch</code>.
<a href="https://twitter.com/indygreg">My colleague Greg</a> calls it &ldquo;the swiss-army knife of Git history rewriting&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I had some fun with filter-branch that day, thought I&rsquo;d finally write an accessible tutorial for it. A lot
of folks treat filter-branch like rebase, but it isn&rsquo;t, and this crucial difference can lead to many
false starts. It certainly did for me back when I first learned it.</p>

<p>This kind of ties into the common bit of pedantry about the nature of a commit I keep seeing pop up:</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ManishEarth/status/837203953926352896">Git commits appear to be diffs, but they&rsquo;re actually file copies, but they&rsquo;re actually ACTUALLY diffs.</a></p></blockquote>

<h2>So what is a git commit?</h2>

<p>Generally we interact with git commits via <code>git show</code> or by looking at commits on
a git GUI / web UI. Here, we see diffs. It&rsquo;s natural to think of a commit as a diff,
it&rsquo;s the model that makes the most sense for the most common ways of interacting
with commits. It also makes some sense from an implementation point of view, diffs
seem like an efficient way of storing things.</p>

<p>It turns out that the &ldquo;real&rdquo; model is not this, it&rsquo;s actually that each commit
is a snapshot of the whole repo state at the time.</p>

<p>But actually, it isn&rsquo;t, the underlying implementation does make use of deltas
in packfiles and some other tricks like copy-on-write forking.</p>

<p>Ultimately, arguing about the &ldquo;real&rdquo; mental model is mostly pedantry. There are
multiple ways of looking at a commit. The documentation tends to implicitly think
of them as &ldquo;full copies of the entire file tree&rdquo;, which is where most
of the confusion about <code>filter-branch</code> comes from. But often it&rsquo;s important
to picture them as diffs, too.</p>

<p>Understanding the implementation can be helpful, especially when you break the
repository whilst doing crazy things (I do this often). I&rsquo;ve explained how it works
in a later section, it&rsquo;s not really a prerequisite for understanding filter-branch,
but it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>

<h2>How do I rewrite history with <code>git rebase</code>?</h2>

<p>This is where some of the confusion around <code>filter-branch</code> stems from. Folks have worked with
<code>rebase</code>, and they think <code>filter-branch</code> is a generalized version of this. They&rsquo;re actually quite
different.</p>

<p>For those of you who haven&rsquo;t worked with <code>git rebase</code>, it&rsquo;s a pretty useful way of rewriting
history, and is probably what you should use when you want to rewrite history, especially for
maintaining clean git history in an unmerged under-review branch.</p>

<p>Rebase does a whole bunch of things. Its core task is, given the current branch and a branch that
you want to &ldquo;rebase onto&rdquo;, it will take all commits unique to your branch, and apply them in order
to the new one. Here, &ldquo;apply&rdquo; means &ldquo;apply the diff of the commit, attempting to resolve any conflicts&rdquo;.
At times, it may ask you to manually resolve the conflicts, using the same tooling
you use for conflicts during <code>git merge</code>.</p>

<p>Rebase is much more powerful than that, though. <code>git rebase -i</code> will open up &ldquo;interactive rebase&rdquo;,
which will show you the commits that are going to be rebased. In this interface, you can reorder
commits, mark them for edits (wherein the rebase will stop at that commit and let you <code>git commit
--amend</code> changes into it), and even &ldquo;squash&rdquo; commits which lets you mark a commit to be absorbed
into the previous one. This is rather useful for when you&rsquo;re working on a feature and want to keep
your commits neat, but also want to make fixup patches to older commits. <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/git-fixup-amending-an-older-commit/">Filippo&rsquo;s <code>git fixup</code> alias</a>
packages this particular task into a single git command. Changing <code>EDITOR=true</code> into
<code>EDITOR=: GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=:</code> will make it not even open the editor for confirmation
and try to do the whole thing automatically.</p>

<p><code>git rebase -x some_command</code> is also pretty neat, lets you run a shell command on each step during a rebase.</p>

<p>In this model, you are fundamentally thinking of commits as diffs. When you move around
commits in the interactive rebase editor, you&rsquo;re moving around diffs. When you mark things
for squashing, you&rsquo;re basically merging diffs. The whole process is about taking a set of
diffs and applying them to a different &ldquo;base commit&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/memes/diffs-everywhere.jpg" width="400"></p>

<h2>How do I rewrite history with <code>git filter-branch</code>?</h2>

<p><code>filter-branch</code> does <em>not</em> work with diffs. You&rsquo;re working with the &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; model
of commits here, where each commit is a snapshot of the tree, and rewriting these commits.</p>

<p>What <code>git filter-branch</code> will do is for each commit in the specified branch, apply filters to the
snapshot, and create a new commit. The new commit&rsquo;s parent will be the filtered version of the old
commit&rsquo;s parent. So it creates a parallel commit DAG.</p>

<p>Because the filters apply on the snapshots instead of the diffs, there&rsquo;s no chance for this to cause
conflicts like in git rebase. In git rebase, if I have one commit that makes changes to a file, and
I change the previous commit to just remove the area of the file that was changed, I&rsquo;d have a conflict
and git would ask me to figure out how the changes are supposed to be applied.</p>

<p>In git-filter-branch, if I do this, it will just power through. Unless you explicitly write
your filters to refer to previous commits, the new commit is created in isolation, so it doesn&rsquo;t
worry about changes to the previous commits. If you had indeed edited the previous commit,
the new commit will appear to undo those changes and apply its own on top of that.</p>

<p><code>filter-branch</code> is generally for operations you want to apply pervasively to a repository. If
you just want to tweak a few commits, it won&rsquo;t work, since future commits will appear to undo
your changes. <code>git rebase</code> is for when you want to tweak a few commits.</p>

<p>So, how do you use it?</p>

<p>The basic syntax is <code>git filter-branch &lt;filters&gt; branch_name</code>. You can use <code>HEAD</code> or <code>@</code>
to refer to the current branch instead of explicitly typing <code>branch_name</code>.</p>

<p>A very simple and useful filter is the subdirectory filter. It makes a given subdirectory
the repository root. You use it via <code>git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter name_of_subdir @</code>.
This is useful for extracting the history of a folder into its own repository.</p>

<p>Another useful filter is the tree filter, you can use it to do things like moving around, creating,
or removing files. For example, if you want to move <code>README.md</code> to <code>README</code> in the entire history,
you&rsquo;d do something like <code>git filter-branch --tree-filter 'mv README.md README' @</code> (you can also
achieve this much faster with some manual work and <code>rebase</code>). The tree filter will work by checking
out each commit (in a separate temporary folder), running your filter on the working directory,
adding any changes to the index (no need to <code>git add</code> yourself), and committing the new index.</p>

<p>The <code>--prune-empty</code> argument is useful here, as it removes commits which are now empty due to the
rewrite.</p>

<p>Because it is checking out each commit, this filter is quite slow. When I initially was trying to
do Steve&rsquo;s task on the rust repo, I wrote a long tree filter and it was taking forever.</p>

<p>The faster version is the index filter. However, this is a bit trickier to work with (which is why I
tend to use a tree filter if I can get away with it). What this does is operate on the index,
directly.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;index&rdquo; is basically where things go when you <code>git add</code> them. Running <code>git add</code> will create
temporary objects for the added file, and modify the WIP index (directory tree) to include a
reference to the new file or change an existing file reference to the new one. When you commit, this
index is packaged up into a commit and stored as an object. (More on how these objects work in a
later section)</p>

<p>Now, since this deals with files that are already stored as objects, git doesn&rsquo;t need to unwrap
these objects and create a working directory to operate on them. So, with <code>--index-filter</code>, you
can operate on these in a much faster way. However, since you don&rsquo;t have a working directory,
stuff like adding and moving files can be trickier. You often have to use <code>git update-index</code>
to make this work.</p>

<p>However, a useful index filter is one which just scrubs a file (or files) from history:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git filter-branch --index-filter <span class="s1">&#39;git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch filename&#39;</span> HEAD
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <code>--ignore-unmatch</code> makes the command still succeed if the file doesn&rsquo;t exist. <code>filter-branch</code>
will fail if one of the filters fails. In general I tend to write fallible filters like
<code>command1 1&gt;&amp;2 2&gt;/dev/null ; command2 1&gt;&amp;2 2&gt;/dev/null ; true</code>, which makes it always succeed
and also ignores any stdout/stderr output (which tends to make the progress screen fill up fast).</p>

<p>The <code>--cached</code> argument on <code>git rm</code> makes it operate only on the index, not the working directory.
This is great, because we don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> a working directory right now.</p>

<p>I rarely use <code>git update-index</code> so I&rsquo;m not really going to try and explain how it can be used here.
But if you need to do more complex operations in an index filter, that&rsquo;s the way to go.</p>

<p>There are many other filters, like <code>--commit-filter</code> (lets you discard a commit entirely),
<code>--msg-filter</code> (rewriting commit messages), and <code>--env-filter</code> (changing things like author metadata
or other env vars). You can see a complete list with examples <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-filter-branch">in the docs</a></p>

<h2>How did I perform the rewrites on the reference and nomicon?</h2>

<p>For the Rust Reference, basically I had to extract the history of <code>src/doc/reference.md</code>,
AND <code>src/doc/reference/*</code> (<code>reference.md</code> was split up into <code>reference/*.md</code> recently) into
its own commit. This is an easy tree filter to write, but tree filters take forever.</p>

<p>Instead of trying my luck with an index filter, I decided to just make it so that the
tree filter would be faster. I first extracted <code>src/doc/</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git filter-branch -f --prune-empty --subdirectory-filter src/doc @
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now I had a branch that contained only the history of <code>src/doc</code>, with the root directory moved to
<code>doc</code>. This is a much smaller repo than the entirety of Rust.</p>

<p>Now, I moved <code>reference.md</code> into <code>reference/</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git filter-branch -f --prune-empty --tree-filter <span class="s1">&#39;mkdir -p reference; mv reference.md reference 1&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null; true&#39;</span> @
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As mentioned before, the <code>/dev/null</code> and <code>true</code> bits are because the mv command will fail in some cases
(when reference.md doesn&rsquo;t exist), and I want it to just continue without complaining when that happens.
I only care about moving instances of that file, if that file doesn&rsquo;t exist there it&rsquo;s still okay.</p>

<p>Now, everything I cared about was within <code>reference</code>. The next step was simple:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git filter-branch -f --prune-empty --subdirectory-filter reference @
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The whole process took maybe 10 minutes to run, most of the time being spent by the second command.
The final result can be found <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/reference">here</a>.</p>

<p>For the nomicon, the task was easier. In the case of the nomicon, it has always resided in
<code>src/doc/nomicon</code>, <code>src/doc/tarpl</code>, or at the root. This last bit is interesting, when
<a href="http://twitter.com/Gankro/">Alexis</a> was working on the nomicon, he started off by hacking on it in a separate repo, but
then within that repo moved it to <code>src/doc/tarpl</code>, and performed a merge commit with rustc. There&rsquo;s
no inherent restriction in Git that all merges must have a common ancestor, and you can do stuff
like this. I was <a href="https://twitter.com/ManishEarth/status/837441118753062912">quite surprised</a> when I saw this, since it&rsquo;s pretty uncommon in general,
but really, many projects of that size will have stuff like this. Servo and html5ever do too, and usually
it&rsquo;s when a large project is merged into it after being developed on the side.</p>

<p>This sounds complicated to work with, but it wasn&rsquo;t that hard. I took the same subdirectory-filtere&rsquo;d
doc directory branch used for the reference. Then, I renamed <code>tarpl/</code> to <code>nomicon/</code> via a tree filter,
and ran another subdirectory filter:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git filter-branch -f --prune-empty --tree-filter <span class="s1">&#39;mv tarpl nomicon 1&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null; true&#39;</span> @
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git filter-branch -f --prune-empty --subdirectory-filter nomicon @
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, I had the whole history of the nomicon in the root dir. Except for the commits made by Alexis
before his frankenmerge, because these got removed in the first subdirectory filter (the commits
were operating outside of <code>src/doc</code>, even though their contents eventually got moved there).</p>

<p>But, at this stage, I already had a branch with the nomicon at the root. Alexis&#8217; original commits
were also operating on the root directory. I can just rebase here, and the diffs of my commits will
cleanly apply!</p>

<p>I found the commit (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/a54e64b3c41103c4f6ab840d8ddd3a56ec6b5da8"><code>a54e64</code></a>) where everything was moved to <code>tarpl/</code>, and took its parent
(<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/c7919f2d9835578321bf7556ad1a01fa42e8a7e8"><code>c7919f</code></a>). Then, I just ran <code>git rebase --root c7919f</code>, and everything cleanly rebased.
As expected, because I had a history going back to the first child of <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/a54e64b3c41103c4f6ab840d8ddd3a56ec6b5da8"><code>a54e64</code></a> with files
moved, and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/a54e64b3c41103c4f6ab840d8ddd3a56ec6b5da8"><code>a54e64</code></a> itself only moved files, so the diffs should cleanly apply.</p>

<p>The final result can be found <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/nomicon">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Appendix: How are commits actually stored?</h2>

<p>The way the actual implementation of a commit works is that each file being stored is hashed and
stored in a compressed format, indexed by the hash. A directory (&ldquo;tree&rdquo;) will be a list of hashes, one for
each file/directory inside it, alongside the filenames and other metadata. This list will be hashed
and used everywhere else to refer to the directory.</p>

<p>A commit will reference the &ldquo;tree&rdquo; object for the root directory via its hash.</p>

<p>Now, if you make a commit changing some files, most of the files will be unchanged. So will most of
the directories. So the commits can share the objects for the unchanged files/directories, reducing
their size. This is basically a copy-on-write model. Furthermore, there&rsquo;s a second optimization
called a &ldquo;packfile&rdquo;, wherein instead of storing a file git will store a delta (a diff) and a
reference to the file the diff must be applied to.</p>

<p>We can see this at work using <code>git cat-file</code>. <code>cat-file</code> lets you view objects in
the &ldquo;git filesystem&rdquo;, which is basically a bunch of hash-indexed objects stored in
<code>.git/objects</code>. You can view them directly by traversing that directory (they&rsquo;re
organized as a trie), but <code>cat-file -p</code> will let you pretty-print their contents
since they&rsquo;re stored in a binary format.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working with <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/book">the repo for the Rust Book</a>,
playing with commit <a href="4822f2baa69c849e4fa3b85204f219a16bde2f42"><code>4822f2</code></a>. It&rsquo;s a commit that changes
just one file (<code>second-edition/src/ch15-01-box.md</code>), perfect.</p>

<p>If you look closely, all of these hashes are the same, <em>except</em> for the hash for <code>second-edition</code>.
For the hashes which are the same, these objects are being shared across commits. The differing hash
is <code>d5672d</code> in the newer commit, and <code>d48b2e</code> in the older one.</p>

which will clutter this post, so I&rsquo;ll run a diff on the outputs of <code>cat-file</code>:</p>

<p>As you can see, only the file that was changed in the commit has a new blob stored.
If you view <code>14c553</code> and <code>29d879</code> you&rsquo;ll get the pre- and post- commit versions
of the file respectively.</p>

<p>So basically, each commit stores a tree of references to objects, often sharing nodes
with other commits.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t had the opportunity to work with packfiles much, but they&rsquo;re an
additional optimization on top of this. <a href="https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/three/unpacking-git-packfiles">Aditya&rsquo;s post</a> is a good
intro to these.</p>

<p>You often hear people saying &ldquo;Language X<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> has sum types&rdquo; or &ldquo;I wish language X had sum types&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>,
or &ldquo;Sum types are cool&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Much like fezzes and bow ties, sum types are indeed cool.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/memes/sum-types-are-cool.jpg" width="400"></p>

<p>These days, I&rsquo;ve also seen people asking about &ldquo;Pi types&rdquo;, because of <a href="https://github.com/ticki/rfcs/blob/pi-types-2/text/0000-pi-types.md">this Rust RFC</a>.</p>

<p>But what does &ldquo;sum type&rdquo; mean? And why is it called that? And what, in the name of sanity, is
a Pi type?</p>

<p>Before I start, I&rsquo;ll mention that while I will be covering some type theory to explain the names
&ldquo;sum&rdquo; and &ldquo;product&rdquo;, you don&rsquo;t need to understand these names to use these things! Far too often
do people have trouble understanding relatively straightforward concepts in languages because
they have confusing names with confusing mathematical backgrounds<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>So what&rsquo;s a sum type? (the no-type-theory version)</h2>

<p>In it&rsquo;s essence, a sum type is basically an &ldquo;or&rdquo; type. Let&rsquo;s first look at structs.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><code>Foo</code> is a <code>bool</code> AND a <code>String</code>. You need one of each to make one.
This is an &ldquo;and&rdquo; type, or a &ldquo;product&rdquo; type (I&rsquo;ll explain the name later).</p>

<p>So what would an &ldquo;or&rdquo; type be? It would be one where the value can be a
<code>bool</code> OR a <code>String</code>. You can achieve this with C++ with a union:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>7</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">string</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">true</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// set it to a bool</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;blah&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// set it to a string</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>However, this isn&rsquo;t <em>exactly</em> right, since the value doesn&rsquo;t store the information
of which variant it is. You could store <code>false</code> and the reader wouldn&rsquo;t know
if you had stored an empty <code>string</code> or a <code>false</code> <code>bool</code>.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a pattern called &ldquo;tagged union&rdquo; (or &ldquo;discriminated union&rdquo;) in C++ which bridges this gap.</p>

<p>Here, you manually set the tag when setting the value. C++ also has <code>std::variant</code> (or
<code>boost::variant</code>) that encapsulates this pattern with a better API.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;m calling these &ldquo;or&rdquo; types here, the technical term for such types is &ldquo;sum&rdquo; types.
Other languages have built-in sum types.</p>

<p>Rust has them and calls them &ldquo;enums&rdquo;. These are a more generalized version of the
enums you see in other languages.</p>

<p>Generally, these languages have &ldquo;pattern matching&rdquo;, which is like a <code>switch</code>
statement on steroids. It lets you match on and destructure all kinds of things,
sum types being one of them. Usually, these are &ldquo;exhaustive&rdquo;, which means that
you are forced to handle all possible cases. In Rust, if you remove that <code>None</code>
branch, the program won&rsquo;t compile. So you&rsquo;re forced to deal with the none case,
<em>somehow</em>.</p>

<p>In general sum types are a pretty neat and powerful tool. Languages with them built-in
tend to make heavy use of them, almost as much as they use structs.</p>

<h2>Why do we call it a sum type?</h2>

<p><em>Here be (type theory) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools">dragons</a></em></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s step back a bit and figure out what a type is.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really a restriction on the values allowed. It can have things like methods and whatnot
dangling off it, but that&rsquo;s not so important here.</p>

<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s like<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)">set</a>. A boolean is the set \(\{\mathtt{true}, \mathtt{false}\}\). An 8-bit unsigned integer
(<code>u8</code> in Rust) is the set \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, &hellip;. 254, 255\}\). A string is a set with
infinite elements, containing all possible valid strings<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s a struct? A struct with two fields contains every possible combination of elements from the two sets.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='rust'><span class='line'><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">bool</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">y</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">u8</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The set of possible values of <code>Foo</code> is</p>

&#92;[&#92;{(\mathtt{x}, \mathtt{y}): \mathtt{x} \in \mathtt{bool}, \mathtt y \in \mathtt{u8}&#92;}&#92;]


<p>(Read as &ldquo;The set of all \((\mathtt{x}, \mathtt{y})\) where \(\tt x\) is in \(\mathtt{bool}\) and \(\tt y\) is in \(\mathtt{u8}\)&rdquo;)</p>

<p>This is called a <em>Cartesian product</em>, and is often represented as \(\tt Foo = bool \times u8\).
An easy way to view this as a product is to count the possible values: The number of possible values
of <code>Foo</code> is the number of possible values of <code>bool</code> (2) <em>times</em> the number of possible values of <code>u8</code> (256).</p>

<p>A general struct would be a &ldquo;product&rdquo; of the types of each field, so something like</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>is \(\mathtt{Bar = bool \times u8 \times bool \times String}\)</p>

<p>This is why structs are called &ldquo;product types&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>.</p>

<p>You can probably guess what comes next &ndash; Rust/Swift enums are &ldquo;sum types&rdquo;, because they are the
<em>sum</em> of the two sets.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='rust'><span class='line'><span class="k">enum</span> <span class="n">Foo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">Bool</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">bool</span><span class="p">),</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">Integer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">u8</span><span class="p">),</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>is a set of all values which are valid booleans, <em>and</em> all values which are valid integers. This
is a sum of sets, \(\tt Foo = bool + u8\). More accurately, it&rsquo;s a <em>disjoint union</em>, where if the input
sets have overlap, the overlap is &ldquo;discriminated&rdquo; out.</p>

<p>An example of this being a disjoint union is:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='rust'><span class='line'><span class="k">enum</span> <span class="n">Bar</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">Bool1</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">bool</span><span class="p">),</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">Bool2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">bool</span><span class="p">),</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">Integer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">u8</span><span class="p">).</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is not \(\tt Bar = bool + bool + u8\), because \(\tt bool + bool = bool\), (regular set addition doesn&rsquo;t duplicate the overlap).</p>

<p>Instead, it&rsquo;s something like</p>

&#92;[\tt Bar = bool + otherbool + u8&#92;]


<p>where \(\tt otherbool\) is also a set \(\tt \{true, false\}\),
except that these elements are <em>different</em> from those in \(\tt bool\). You can look at it as if</p>

&#92;[\tt otherbool = &#92;{true_2, false_2&#92;}&#92;]


<p>so that</p>

&#92;[\mathtt{bool + otherbool} = &#92;{\mathtt{true, false, true_2, false_2}&#92;}&#92;]


<p>For sum types, the number of possible values is the sum of the number of possible values of
each of its component types.</p>

<p>So, Rust/Swift enums are &ldquo;sum types&rdquo;.</p>

<p>You may often notice the terminology &ldquo;algebraic datatypes&rdquo; (ADT) being used, usually that&rsquo;s just
talking about sum and product types together &ndash; a language with ADTs will have both.</p>

<p>In fact, you can even have <em>exponential</em> types! The notation A<sup>B</sup> in set theory does mean something,
it&rsquo;s the set of all possible mappings from \(B\) to \(A\). The number of elements is \(N_A^{N_B}\). So
basically, the type of a function (which is a mapping) is an &ldquo;exponential&rdquo; type. You can also view it as
an iterated product type, a function from type <code>B</code> to <code>A</code> is really a struct like this:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>given a value of the input <code>b</code>, the function will find the right field of <code>my_func</code> and return
the mapping. Since a struct is a product type, this is</p>

&#92;[\mathtt{A}^{N_\mathtt{B}} = \tt A \times A \times A \times \dots&#92;]


<p>making it an exponential type.</p>

<p><a href="http://strictlypositive.org/diff.pdf">You can even take <em>derivatives</em> of types!</a> (h/t Sam Tobin-Hochstadt for pointing this out to me)</p>

<h2>What, in the name of sanity, is a Pi type?</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/memes/what-in-the-name-of-sanity.jpg" width="400"></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s essentially a form of dependent type. A dependent type is when your type
can depend on a value. An example of this is integer generics, where you
can do things like <code>Array&lt;bool, 5&gt;</code>, or <code>template&lt;unsigned int N, typename T&gt; Array&lt;T, N&gt; ...</code> (in C++).</p>

<p>Note that the type signature contains a <em>type</em> dependent on an integer, being generic over multiple
different array lengths.</p>

<p>The name comes from how a constructor for these types would look:</p>

<p>Given an input, the function chooses the right child function here, and calls it.</p>

<p>This is a struct, or a product type! But it&rsquo;s a product of an infinite number of types<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p>

<p>We can look at it as</p>

&#92;[&#92;texttt{make_array} = \prod\limits_{x = 0}^\infty\left( \texttt{fn()} \mathtt\to \texttt{Array&lt;bool, x&gt;}\right)&#92;]


<p>The usage of the \(\Pi\) symbol to denote an iterative product gives this the name &ldquo;Pi type&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In languages with lazy evaluation (like Haskell), there is no difference between having a function
that can give you a value, and actually having the value. So, the type of <code>make_array</code> is the type
of <code>Array&lt;bool, N&gt;</code> itself in languages with lazy evaluation.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a notion of a &ldquo;sigma&rdquo; type, which is basically</p>

&#92;[\sum\limits_{x = 0}^\infty \left(\texttt{fn()} \mathtt\to \texttt{Array&lt;bool, x&gt;}\right)&#92;]


<p>With the Pi type, we had &ldquo;for all N we can
construct an array&rdquo;, with the sigma type we have &ldquo;there exists some N for which we can construct this array&rdquo;.
As you can expect, this type can be expressed with a possibly-infinite enum, and instances of this type
are basically instances of <code>Array&lt;bool, N&gt;</code> for some specific <code>N</code> where the <code>N</code> is only known at runtime.
(much like how regular sum types are instances of one amongst multiple types, where the exact type
is only known at runtime). <code>Vec&lt;bool&gt;</code> is conceptually similar to the sigma type <code>Array&lt;bool, ?&gt;</code>,
as is <code>&amp;[bool]</code>.</p>

<h2>Wrapping up</h2>

<p>Types are sets, and we can do set-theory things on them to make cooler types.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try to avoid using confusing terminology, however. If Rust <em>does</em> get &ldquo;pi types&rdquo;,
let&rsquo;s just call them &ldquo;dependent types&rdquo; or &ldquo;const generics&rdquo; :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This may be part of a collaborative blog post series about underhanded Rust code. Or it may not. I invite you to write your own posts about underhanded code to make it so!</em></p>

<p>The <a href="https://underhanded.rs/blog/2017/02/28/extending-submission-deadline.en-US.html">submission deadline for the Underhanded Rust competition has been extended</a>, so
let&rsquo;s talk more about how to keep your code working and free from bugs/underhandedness!</p>

<p><a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2017/01/21/mitigating-underhandedness-clippy/">Previously, we talked about Clippy</a>.</p>

<p>Now, really, underhanded bugs are just another form of bug. And how do we find bugs? We test!</p>

<p>We write unit tests. We run the code under Valgrind, ASan, MSan, UBSan, TSan, and any other sanitizer
we can get our hands on. Tests tests tests. More tests. Tests.</p>

<p>But, there&rsquo;s a problem here. You need to write <em>test cases</em> to make this work. These are inputs
fed to your code after which you check whatever invariants your code has. There&rsquo;s
no guarantee that the test cases you write will exercise all the code paths in your
program. This applies for sanitizers too, sanitizers are limited to testing the code paths
that your test cases hit.</p>

<p>Of course, you can use code coverage tools to ensure that all these code paths will be hit.
However, there&rsquo;s a conflict here &ndash; your code will have many code paths that are
<em>not supposed to be hit ever</em>. Things like redundant bounds checks, null checks, etc.
In Rust programs such code paths generally use panics.</p>

<p>Now, these code paths are never <em>supposed</em> to be hit, so they&rsquo;ll never show up in your
code coverage. But you don&rsquo;t have a guarantee that they can never be hit, short
of formally verifying your program. The only solution here is writing more test cases.</p>

<p>Aside from that, even ignoring those code paths, you still need to manually write
test cases for everything. For each possible code path in your code, if you want to
be sure.</p>

<p>Who wants to manually write a million test cases?</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/memes/aint-nobody.jpg" width="400"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/post/memes/that-would-be-great.jpg" width="400"></p>

<p>Enter fuzzing. What fuzzing will do is feed your program random inputs, carefully watching the
codepaths being taken, and try to massage the inputs so that new, interesting (usually crashy)
codepaths are taken. You write tests for the fuzzer such that they can accept arbitrary input, and
the fuzzer will find cases where they crash or panic.</p>

<p>One of the most popular fuzzers out there is <a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/">AFL</a>, which takes a binary and feeds it random
input. Rust <a href="https://github.com/rust-fuzz/afl.rs">has a library that you can use for running AFL</a>, however it currently needs
to be run via a Docker image or needs a recompilation of rustc, since it adds a custom LLVM pass.
We&rsquo;re working on making this step unnecessary.</p>

<p>However, as of a few weeks ago, we now have bindings for <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html">libFuzzer</a>, which uses existing
instrumentation options built in to LLVM itself! libFuzzer works a bit differently; instead
of giving it a binary, you write a function in a special way and give it a library containing
that function, which it turns into a fuzzer binary. This is faster, since the fuzzer lives
inside the binary itself and it doesn&rsquo;t need to execute a new program each time.</p>

<p>Using libFuzzer in Rust is easy. Install <a href="https://github.com/rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz"><code>cargo-fuzz</code></a>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>cargo install cargo-fuzz
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, within your crate, initialize the fuzz setup:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>cargo fuzz init
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will create a fuzzing crate in <code>fuzz/</code>, with a single &ldquo;fuzz target&rdquo;, <code>fuzzer_script_1</code>.
You can add more such targets with <code>cargo fuzz add name_of_target</code>. Fuzz targets are small libraries
with a single function in them; the function that will be called over and over again by the fuzzer.
It is up to you to fill in the body of this function, such that the program will crash or panic
if and only if something goes wrong.</p>

<p>For example, for the <code>unicode-segmentation</code> crate, <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/unicode-segmentation/blob/99b3636ef6b4d96c05644403c1c2eccba2c5f5db/fuzz/fuzzers/equality.rs">one of the fuzz targets I wrote</a> just
takes the string, splits it by grapheme and word boundaries, recombines it, and then asserts that
the new string is the same.</p>

<p>The other targets ensure that the forward and reverse word/grapheme
iterators produce the same results. They all take the byte slice input, attempt to convert to UTF8
(silently failing  &ndash; NOT panicking &ndash; if not possible), and then use the string as an input
testcase.</p>

<p>Now, these targets will panic if the test fails, and the fuzzer will try and force that panic to
happen. But also, these targets put together exercise most of the API surface of the crate, so
the fuzzer may also find panics (or even segmentation faults!) in the crate itself. For example,
the <a href="https://github.com/servo/rust-url/blob/3e5541e51e02d8acb10a6ea8ab174ba1bc23ce41/fuzz/fuzzers/parse.rs#L10">fuzz target for rust-url</a> doesn&rsquo;t itself assert; all it does is try to parse the given
string. The fuzzer will try to get the URL parser to panic.</p>

<p>To run a fuzz script:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>cargo fuzz run fuzzer_script_1
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will start the fuzzer, running until it finds a crash or panic. It may also
find other things like inputs which make the code abnormally slow.</p>

<p>Fuzzing can find some interesting bugs. For example, the unicode-segmentation
fuzzers found <a href="https://github.com/unicode-rs/unicode-segmentation/issues/19">this bug</a>, where an emoji followed by <em>two</em> skin tone modifiers
isn&rsquo;t handled correctly. We&rsquo;d probably never have been able to come up with this testcase on our
own. But the fuzzer could find it!</p>

<p>The Rust Cap&#8217;n Proto crate ran cargo-fuzz and found <a href="https://dwrensha.github.io/capnproto-rust/2017/02/27/cargo-fuzz.html">a whole ton of bugs</a>. There
are more such examples <a href="https://github.com/rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz#trophy-case">in the trophy case</a> (be sure to add any of your own findings
to the trophy case, too!)</p>

<p>cargo-fuzz is relatively new, so the API and behavior may still be tweaked a bit before 1.0.
But you can start taking it for a spin now, and finding bugs!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week Google published a <a href="https://shattered.io/">SHA-1 collision</a>.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of confusion about the implications of this. A lot of this is due to differences of
opinion on what exactly constitutes a &ldquo;new&rdquo; collision. I <a href="https://twitter.com/ManishEarth/status/835557328308969472">tweeted about this</a>. The webpage
for the attack itself is misleading, saying that the answer to &ldquo;Who is capable of mounting this attack?&rdquo;
is people with Google-esque resources. This depends on what exactly you mean by &ldquo;this attack&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m seeing a lot of &ldquo;oh well just another anti-milestone for SHA, doesn&rsquo;t affect anyone since its
still quite expensive to exploit&rdquo; reactions, as well as the opposite &ldquo;aaaaa everything is on fire&rdquo;
reaction. Both are wrong. It has practical implications for you even if you are certain that you
won&rsquo;t attract the ire of an entity with a lot of computational power. None of these implications,
however, are likely to be disastrous.</p>

<p>TLDR: Now <em>anyone</em>, without needing Google-esque resources,
can generate two colliding PDFs with arbitrary visual content in each.</p>

<p>(In fact, there&rsquo;s already <a href="http://alf.nu/SHA1">a PDF collision-generator</a> up where
you can upload two images and get a PDF with collisions in it)</p>

<h2>Okay, back up a bit. What&rsquo;s a hash? What&rsquo;s SHA-1?</h2>

<p>I explained this a bit in my older post about <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2016/03/05/exploring-zero-knowledge-proofs/">zero-knowledge-proofs</a>.</p>

<p>In essence, a hash function takes some data (usually of arbitrary size), and produces a value called
a <em>hash</em> (usually of fixed size). The function has some additional properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>In almost all cases, a small perturbation in the input will lead to a large perturbation in the hash</li>
<li>Given an input and its hash, it is computationally hard to find an alternate input producing the same hash</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s also hard to just find two inputs that has to the same value, though this is usually easier than the previous one</li>
</ul>


<p>when two inputs hash to the same value, this is called a collision. As mentioned, is easier to find
<em>a</em> collision, over finding a colliding alternate input for a known input.</p>

<p>SHA-1 is one such hash function. It&rsquo;s been known for a while that it&rsquo;s insecure, and the industry has
largely moved off of it, but it&rsquo;s still used, so it can still be a problem.</p>

<h2>What did the researchers do?</h2>

<p>They found a hash collision for SHA-1. In essence, they found two strings, <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, where
<code>SHA1(A) == SHA1(B)</code>.</p>

<p><em>However</em>, given the way SHA-1 works, this means that you can generate infinitely many other
such pairs of strings. And given the nature of the exact <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> they created, it is possible
to use this to create arbitrary colliding PDFs.</p>

<p>Basically, SHA-1 (and many other hash functions), operate on &ldquo;blocks&rdquo;. These are fixed-size chunks
of data, where the size is a property of the hash function. For SHA1 this is 512 bits.</p>

<p>The function starts off with an &ldquo;initial&rdquo; built-in hash. It takes the first block of your data and
this hash, and does some computation with the two to produce a new hash, which is its state after
the first block.</p>

<p>It will then take this hash and the second block, and run the same computations to produce
a newer hash, which is its state after the second block. This is repeated till all blocks have
been processed, and the final state is the result of the function.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s an important thing to notice here. At each block, the only inputs are the block itself and the
hash of the string up to that block.</p>

<p>This means, if <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are of a size that is a multiple of the block size, and <code>SHA1(A) == SHA1(B)</code>,
then <code>SHA1(A + C) == SHA1(B + C)</code>. This is because, when the hash function reaches <code>C</code>, the state will
be the same due to the hash collision, and after this point the next input blocks are identical in
both cases, so the final hash will be the same.</p>

<p>Now, while you might consider <code>A+C, B+C</code> to be the &ldquo;same collision&rdquo; as <code>A, B</code>, the implications
of this are different than just &ldquo;there is now one known pair of inputs that collide&rdquo;, since everyone
now has the ability to generate new colliding inputs by appending an arbitrary string to <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>.</p>

<p>Of course, these new collisions have the restriction that the strings will always start with <code>A</code> or
<code>B</code> and the suffixes will be identical. If you want to break this restriction, you will
have to devote expensive resources to finding a new collision, like Google did.</p>

<h2>How does this let us generate arbitrary colliding PDFs?</h2>

<p>So this exploit actually uses features of the JPEG format to work. It was done in
a PDF format since JPEGs often get compressed when sent around the Internet. However,
since both A and B start a partial PDF document, they can only be used to generate colliding
PDFs, not JPEGs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to first sketch out a simplified example of what this is doing, using a hypothetical
pseudocode-y file format. The researchers found a collision between the strings:</p>

<ul>
<li>A: <code>&lt;header data&gt; COMMENT(&lt;nonce for A&gt;) DISPLAY IMAGE 1</code></li>
<li>B: <code>&lt;header data&gt; COMMENT(&lt;nonce for B&gt;) DISPLAY IMAGE 2</code></li>
</ul>


<p>Here, <code>&lt;header data&gt;</code> is whatever is necessary to make the format work, and the &ldquo;nonce&#8221;s are
strings that make <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> have the same hash. Finding these nonces is where
the computational power is required, since you basically have to brute-force a solution.</p>

<p>Now, to both these strings, they append a suffix C: <code>IMAGE 1(&lt;data for image 1&gt;) IMAGE 2(&lt;data for image 2&gt;)</code>.
This creates two complete documents. Both of the documents contain both images, but each one is instructed
to display a different one. Note that since <code>SHA1(A) == SHA1(B)</code>, <code>SHA1(A + C) = SHA1(B + C)</code>, so these
final documents have the same hash.</p>

<p>The contents of <code>C</code> don&rsquo;t affect the collision at all. So, we can insert any two images in <code>C</code>, to create
our own personal pair of colliding PDFs.</p>

<p>The actual technique used is similar to this, and it relies on JPEG comment fields. They have found
a collision between two strings that look like:</p>

<p>By playing with the nonces, they managed to generate a collision between <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. In the first
pdf, the embedded image has a comment containing only the nonce. Once the JPEG reader gets past that
comment, it sees the first image, displays it, and then sees the end-of-file marker and decides to
stop. Since the PDF format doesn&rsquo;t try to interpret the image itself, the PDF format won&rsquo;t be
boggled by the fact that there&rsquo;s some extra garbage data after the JPEG EOF marker. It
simply takes all the data between the &ldquo;begin embedded image&rdquo; and &ldquo;end embedded image&rdquo; blocks,
and passes it to the JPEG decoder. The JPEG decoder itself stops after it sees the end of file
marker, and doesn&rsquo;t get to the extra data for the second image.</p>

<p>In the second pdf, the jpg comment is longer, and subsumes the first image (as well as the EOF marker)
Thus, the JPEG decoder directly gets to the second image, which it displays.</p>

<p>Since the actual images are not part of the original collision (A and B), you can substitute any pair
of jpeg images there, with some length restrictions.</p>

<h2>What are the implications?</h2>

<p>This does mean that you should not trust the integrity of a PDF when all you have
to go on is its SHA-1 hash. Use a better hash. <em>Anyone can generate these colliding PDFs
now.</em></p>

<p>Fortunately, since all such PDFs will have the same prefix A or B, you can detect when
such a deception is being carried out.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t check colliding PDFs into SVN. <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=168774#c27">Things break</a>.</p>

<p>In some cases it is possible to use the PDF collision in other formats. For example,
<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/arw/status/834883944898125824">it can be used to create colliding HTML documents</a>. I think it can be used to colide
ZIP files too.</p>

<p>Outside the world of complex file formats, little has changed. It&rsquo;s still a bad idea to use SHA-1.
It&rsquo;s still possible for people to generate entirely new collisions like Google did, though this
needs a lot of resources. It&rsquo;s possible that someone with resources has already generated such a
&ldquo;universal-key collision&rdquo; for some other file format<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and will use it on you, but this was
equally possible before Google published their attack.</p>

<p>This does not make it easier to collide with arbitrary hashes &ndash; if someone else
has uploaded a document with a hash, and you trust them to not be playing any tricks,
an attacker won&rsquo;t be able to generate a colliding document for this without immense
resources. The attack only works when the attacker has control over the initial document;
e.g. in a bait-and-switch-like attack where the attacker uploads document A, you read and verify it
and broadcast your trust in document A with hash <code>SHA(A)</code>, and then the attacker switches it with
document B.</p>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>Google&rsquo;s specific collision was designed to be a &ldquo;universal key&rdquo;, since A and B are designed to have the image-switching mechanism built into it. Some other collision may not be like this; it could just be a collision of two images (or whatever) with no such switching mechanism. It takes about the same effort to do either of these, however, so if you have a file format that can be exploited to create a switching mechanism, it would always make more sense to build one into any collision you look for.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
