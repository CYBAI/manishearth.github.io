I'll be moving from my [old Blogger-powered blog](http://inpursuitoflaziness.blogspot.in/)
to this new one powered by github pages and Octopress. I never enjoyed writing a blog in WYSIWYG
or HTML (I would constantly switch between both and still get the formatting wrong); Markdown is
my cup of tea.

I may "uplift" some of my favorite posts to this blog later.

I'm quite excited!
