Whose words are these I think I know<br>
His house is in the village though<br>
He will not see me stopping here<br>
To interpret his work as I go<br>


My little student must think it queer<br>
To read without some context near<br>
Between the words and the intent<br>
He wonders what the poem meant<br>

He gives his head a little shake<br>
To ask if there is some mistake<br>
"That's not what the author said!"<br>
Providing another view instead<br>

The words are lovely, dark, and deep<br>
But I have literary criticism to preach<br>
And miles to go before I sleep<br>
And miles to go before I sleep<br>

Seriously though, try reading _The Road Not Taken_ as metacircular commentary on how the poem
[is very often "mis"interpreted][mis], and the nature of interpretation / _Death of the Author_. It fits perfectly when
you read "road" as "interpretation".

<small>(Yes, I know, the parody above is not based on _The Road Not Taken_ but instead a different Frost
poem. I was originally going to modify _The Road Not Taken_ but realized all I had to do was change
a few words to get there, which was no fun at all) </small>
