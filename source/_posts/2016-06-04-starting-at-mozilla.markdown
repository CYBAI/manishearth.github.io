I got a job!

I'm now working at Mozilla as a Research Engineer, on [Servo][servo].

I started two weeks ago, and so far I'm really enjoying it! I feel quite lucky to
get to work on an open source project; with an amazing and helpful team. Getting to do most
of my work in Rust is great, too :)

So far I've been working on the network stack (specifically, ["making fetch happen"][fetch]),
and I'll probably be spending time on DOM things as well.

Really excited to see how this goes!
